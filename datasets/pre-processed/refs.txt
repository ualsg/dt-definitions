 and the reconfiguration of the iWarehouse using the DT. The second approach, which was raised in a survey, involves reconfiguring the iWarehouse according to a common industrial rebuilding process without the support of the Digital Twin. Therefore, the potential of the Digital Twin cannot be used for reconfiguration, such as model-bas

[19] present a review of DT applications in aerospace; the authors describe that, because a commercial aircraft may have more than half a million different component references, it is challenging to create a bijective relation between a particular physical aircraft and its unique digital twin. The complexity in implementation of DT also arises due to the interoperability issues among the di

he digital twin has been adapted to deal with cyber-physical systems (Korth et al., 2018). A recent review (Kritzinger, Karner, Traar, Henjes, & Sihn, 2018) divides digital twin into three groups regarding data automation and integration, specifically digital model, digital shadow, and digital twin. In the first one, the data flow is all manual, in the second one the data flow from the physical o
