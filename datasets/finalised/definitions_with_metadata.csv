However, after about a quarter of a century of research and development, only a handful of commercial alloys can be printed and the market value of all 3D printed products now amounts to a negligible portion of the manufacturing economy. This difficulty is attributable to a remarkable diversity in structure and properties of the printed components and susceptibility to defects. In addition, the current practice of qualifying components by prolonged trial and error with expensive printing equipment and feed stock material confine the printed products to a niche market where the high product cost and the delay in the qualification are not critical factors.

Initially, the structure and operation mechanism of this framework are proposed. It is designed to support the sharing of data, knowledge and resources. As a key supporting technology, the digital twin is also integrated into it to improve the accuracy of fault diagnosis and prediction and support making a maintenance plan with higher accuracy and reliability. Then, under this framework, an integrated mathematical programming model is established with considering the parameter uncertainty and an NSGA-II hybrid algorithm is utilized to solve it.

Finally, a case, prediction maintenance decision-making for bearings in grinding rolls of the large vertical mill, is studied.

Simulation has been used in different industries to detect bottlenecks and plan operations, and it has been determined that one of its most important tasks is the selection of input data, this is where the use of visual data for mining comes into play. and the correction and interpretation of the same using artificial intelligence. In this case study, the input data selection process and the procedure built for the execution of a simulation that generates value in the real process can be evidenced, through the case study it was possible to determine that an increase in production and a reduction in emissions and fuel consumption through the optimization of hauling routes, these optimizations included the reduction of slopes and the correction of widths according to the dimensions of the trucks.",false,2022-12-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405896322030725,"{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Torres, Liza Carolina Castellanos'}","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405896322030725'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896322030725'}]",,application/json,,S2405-8963(22)03072-5,", IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.",Case study: simulation and artificial intelligence application for the optimization of the hauling and loading process in an open-pit mining system,"© 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.",0,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Mining'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Industry 4.0'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Simulation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Artificial intelligence'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'optimization'}]",false,IFAC-PapersOnLine,,265-269,269,fla,2022,10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.12.032,265,doi:10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.12.032,,24058963,55,39,39,"21st IFAC Conference on Technology, Culture and International Stability TECIS 2022- Prishtina, Kosovo, 26–28 October 2022",,

The digital twin has emerged as a solution that can update a BIM model with real-time data to achieve cyber-physical integration, enabling real-time monitoring of assets and activities and improving decision-making. The application of digital twins in the construction industry is still in its nascent stages but has been steadily growing over the past few years. A wide variety of emerging technologies are being used in the development of digital twins in diverse applications in construction but it is not immediately clear from the literature which ones are key to the successful development of digital twins, necessitating a systematic literature review with a focus on technologies. This paper aims to identify the key technologies used in the development of digital twins in construction in the existing literature, the research gaps and the potential areas for future research. This is achieved by conducting a systematic review of studies with demonstrative case studies and experimental setups in construction.

As buildings are designed, constructed, and operated for long-term periods with uncertainties, it is essential to model, verify, extend, and calibrate the digital twin models in situ over the building life cycle, unlike digital twin modeling in the manufacturing industries. Therefore, this study proposes in situ model fusion techniques for building digital twinning, which include (1) model coupling and (2) model assembly. The first model coupling technique enables nonintrusive in situ verification and calibration for prediction models without the model observations (Y). The second model assembly enables in situ modeling or a more accurate model construction by connecting the verified models through the model coupling technique to the input layer of the target model. In the case studies conducted in a central heating system, the prediction model for the secondary-side return water temperature was modeled and calibrated without relying on the model observation data (Y), thanks to the model coupling technique. The nonintrusive model showed an accuracy with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.53 °C, which was comparable to the intrusive gray-box models (around 0.5 °C RMSE) calibrated using intrusive datasets (Y). Additionally, the prediction model could improve the benchmark model's performance from 0.44 °C to 0.26 °C (RMSE) using the model assembly technique.

We present a method for robust testing of engineered soft tissue products involving a digital twin paradigm in combination with robotic systems. We developed and validated a digital twin framework for calibrating and controlling robotic-biological systems. A forward dynamics model of the robotic manipulator was developed, calibrated, and validated. After calibration, the accuracy of the digital twin in reproducing the experimental data improved in the time domain for all fourteen tested configurations and improved in frequency domain for nine configurations. We then demonstrated displacement control of a spring in lieu of a soft tissue element in a biological specimen. The simulated experiment matched the physical experiment with 0.09 mm (0.001%) root-mean-square error for a 2.9 mm (5.1%) length change. Finally, we demonstrated kinematic control of a digital twin of the knee through 70-degree passive flexion kinematics. The root-mean-square error was 2.00°, 0.57°, and 1.75° degrees for flexion, adduction, and internal rotations, respectively. The system well controlled novel mechanical elements and generated accurate kinematics in silico for a complex knee model. This calibration method could be applied to other situations where the specimen is poorly represented in the model environment (e.g., human or animal tissues), and the control system could be extended to track internal parameters such as tissue strain (e.g., control knee ligament strain).

Conventional load frequency control has difficulty overcoming the above problems due to its lack of adaptive control ability and robustness. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a sea computing-based grid-area coordinated load frequency control (SCGAC-LFC) method, which equates each grid unit and area unit in each area as independent agents. Instead of different units relying on different strategies, all units collectively obtain the LFC policy that suits the market requirements. In its online application, no communication is needed since each unit can arrive at its own decision. In addition, this paper proposes a curriculum multiagent deep meta-actor-critic (CMA-DMAC) algorithm, which introduces meta-reinforcement learning and curriculum learning to guide the agent training to improve the robustness and quality of the obtained SCGAC-LFC strategies.

The role of directors is to govern their organizations. Good governance includes contributing to and overseeing strategy, risk management, legal compliance, and financial management. It also means keeping fresh food safe in their supply chains. Corporate responses to addressing new food safety risks will be critical for ensuring the secure supply of safe food globally. The linkage of climate change to fresh food safety was reviewed and analyzed. Implications are discussed based on the changing governance and regulatory landscape for individual directors, their boards, and organizations in the sector. The review identifies technical impacts as well as emerging governance requirements (including transition risks) for directors. This paper takes the perspective of directors of organizations in the fresh food supply chain (also referred to as the food safety chain) and reviews available and credible knowledge concerning climate risks. Academic and selected grey literature, regulatory position papers, investor and expert opinions, and company annual reports, were reviewed to gain insights into the direct impacts on fresh foods and financial risks from climate change and identify emerging regulatory trends in governance. While there is an identifiable link between physical threats from climate change in this area of agriculture and food production and the management of businesses in the fresh food value chain, the governance of the overall food safety chain is diverse and robust. There is extensive research underway to assess emerging risks, with international laws and standards that enable the mitigation of emerging threats. While manifesting for directors as transitional risks, each of these aspects of governance offers an opportunity for organizations (in the food value or food safety chain) to be proactive about fresh food safety. Understanding the changing expectations of directors concerning the impact of climate change, which is diverse as this review shows, has not been reviewed previously.

However, practical adoptions of this technology have been slower, mainly due to a lack of application-specific details. Here we focus on a digital twin framework for linear single-degree-of-freedom structural dynamic systems evolving in two different operational time scales in addition to its intrinsic dynamic time-scale. Our approach strategically separates into two components – (a) a physics-based nominal model for data processing and response predictions, and (b) a data-driven machine learning model for the time-evolution of the system parameters. The physics-based nominal model is system-specific and selected based on the problem under consideration. On the other hand, the data-driven machine learning model is generic. For tracking the multi-timescale evolution of the system parameters, we propose to exploit a mixture of experts as the data-driven model. Within the mixture of experts model, Gaussian Process (GP) is used as the expert model. The primary idea is to let each expert track the evolution of the system parameters at a single time-scale. For learning the hyperparameters of the ‘mixture of experts using GP’, an efficient framework that exploits expectation-maximization and sequential Monte Carlo sampler is used. Performance of the digital twin is illustrated on a multi-timescale dynamical system with stiffness and/or mass variations. The digital twin is found to be robust and yields reasonably accurate results. One exciting feature of the proposed digital twin is its capability to provide reasonable predictions at future time-steps.

The digital twin of the crane is simulated real-time in a nonlinear finite element (FE) program, where the estimated payload weight is used as an input. We implement an inverse method for estimation of the weight as well as its force vector direction based on physical strain gauge measurements. Additional strain gauges were utilized for validation of accuracy of the digital twin and inverse method. Based on a few physical sensor outputs, the digital twin allows for real-time determination of stresses, strains and loads at an unlimited number of hot spots. Therefore a digital twin can be an effective tool for predictive maintenance and product life-cycle management. In addition, condition monitoring of cranes during heavy-lift operations increases safety and reliability. The presented approach is described in a general manner and is applicable for various robotic manipulators used in the industry.",false,2020-05-31,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350630719315742,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Moi, Torbjørn'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Cibicik, Andrej'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Rølvåg, Terje'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1350630719315742'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350630719315742'}]",,application/json,Full,S1350-6307(19)31574-2,The Authors.

This can be done using genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic or proteomic information. Personalized medicine holds great promise, especially in cancer therapy and control, where precision oncology would allow medical practitioners to use this information to optimize the treatment of a patient. Personalized oncology for groups of individuals would also allow for the use of population group specific diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. Additionally, this information can be used to track the progress of the disease or monitor the response of the patient to treatment. This can be used to establish the molecular basis for drug resistance and allow the targeting of the genes or pathways responsible for drug resistance. Personalized medicine requires the use of large data sets, which must be processed and analysed in order to identify the particular molecular patterns that can inform the decisions required for personalized care. However, the analysis of these large data sets is difficult and time consuming. This is further compounded by the increasing size of these datasets due to technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS). These difficulties can be met through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These computational tools use specific neural networks, learning methods, decision making tools and algorithms to construct and improve on models for the analysis of different types of large data sets. These tools can also be used to answer specific questions. Artificial intelligence can also be used to predict the effects of genetic changes on protein structure and therefore function.

One reason that the usage of Digital Twins is becoming increasingly important are current trends, such as individualized mass production, which lead to more frequent reconfigurations of production systems or require higher flexibility. At the same time, many production systems have been in productive use for some time, so-called brownfield systems. Most of them do not have a Digital Twin, but would benefit from one, if available. However, the creation of a Digital Twin is a significant additional effort, due to the creation of the underlying models and the relations between them. Some promising approaches for the creation of domain-specific models already exist, which can be used for the creation of the unconnected parts of a Digital Twin. However, there are still few results for the creation of inter-domain relations, which cause problems in the creation of Digital Twins. This paper therefore presents a methodology for the automated reconstruction of functional relations as well as the separation of functionally related component groups of the plant and its software. For this purpose, the methodology imports the native PLC code via XML, extracts the relevant information from the code and enriches the resulting information model with explicit information about implicit relations in the code.

The aim of the article is to draw attention to the problems in the field of parking vehicles in a smart city, which should be solved as soon as possible. Problems related to parking in the city are a common challenge that can affect the comfort of living of residents, traffic, natural environment and transport efficiency. Many cities lack parking spaces in relation to the number of vehicles, leading to difficulties in finding a parking space. This can lead to traffic jams that increase the time it takes to find a parking space, increase traffic-related emissions and reduce the quality of life for residents. The research method to solve the problem related to the management of parking spaces is focused on the analysis of the city's problems and guidelines resulting from the sustainable development of the European Union. In the application part, open data resources were used to carry out the simulation in the proprietary application solution. The result of the article, which is a scientific research, is the presentation of the author's application in the Digital Twin concept for the simulation of parking space management. The simulation is the result of research conducted using open data published on the Internet. The conclusion of the research is that in the process of effective management of parking spaces, simulation in the Digital Twin concept can be used.

However, aerospace composite structures are prone to damage due to high-velocity impact events such as bird strike, hail impact, etc. These impact events can result in extensive damage including structure perforation, which will eventually degrade its post-impact residual strength. Therefore, the early detection of damage in composite structure is imperative to avoid catastrophic failure. This paper develops the computational models which predict the dynamic behavior of a helicopter composite sandwich structure undergoing a bird strike. The models are aimed to be used as virtual tools for a future digital-twin-assisted fault detection technique. Firstly, a high-fidelity (HF) FE/SPH model was developed in LS-DYNA, and it was validated against the soft body impact experiments. Afterwards, a computationally efficient low-fidelity (LF) model was developed and correlated with the high-fidelity model. It was concluded that the high-fidelity model can sufficiently accurately predict the strain history experimentally recorded by the FBG sensors, and that size of the predicted delamination area at the front face of the sandwich structure agrees very well with the experimentally observed delamination area. It was also shown that the LF model can rapidly predict the global dynamic response of sandwich panel under the impact loading, through the good agreement between the numerical strain histories with the FBG measurements. Consequently, the LF model can be used as a quick numerical guide for the identification of the loading condition, whereas the HF model can be used as virtual damage detector and estimator of damage extension before the scheduled inspection.",false,2022-02-28,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0734743X21002451,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Giannaros, E.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Kotzakolios, A.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Kostopoulos, V.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Sotiriadis, G.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Vignjevic, R.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Djordjevic, N.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Boccaccio, M.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Meo, M.'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0734743X21002451'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734743X21002451'}]",,application/json,,S0734-743X(21)00245-1,Elsevier Ltd.,"Low- and high-fidelity modeling of sandwich-structured composite response to bird strike, as tools for a digital-twin-assisted damage diagnosis",© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the deployment of edge servers close to IoT devices has strengthened the edge computing paradigm. With the collaboration of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and cloud computing, delay-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks can be offloaded to the edge/cloud servers to improve system performance in terms of the delay and energy consumption of IoT devices. However, there is a need to schedule the computation tasks for an efficient management. More importantly, the task scheduling strategy can face data tampering attacks to deliberately modify, destroy or manipulate the decisions. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we newly propose to integrate digital twin and blockchain into the edge networks. However, it is unclear (i) how energy and delay-aware computation should be combined, and (ii) which mining computations should be executed for a secure task scheduling. The state-of-the-art focuses on task scheduling and blockchain mining, separately. Therefore, we propose a novel blockchain-based digital twin-edge network architecture where our proposed algorithm solves these two challenges at the same execution. We design a three-layer system architecture, composed of physical entity layer, digital twin edge layer and blockchain layer. In the physical entity layer, we formulate an energy and delay-aware task scheduling problem. In the digital twin edge layer, we propose a novel Proof of Evaluation (PoE)-based secure energy and delay-aware task scheduling algorithm where optimization is executed by the genetic algorithm implementation of Warehouse Location Problem (WLP). In the blockchain layer, the best-found solutions are shared with the topology in a blockchain. Here, each block includes the hash of the previous block, a genetic algorithm-based solution, nonce value, and a hash of whole blocks in the blockchain. Thus, we aim to execute the computation tasks with an acceptable delay in an energy-efficient manner and prevent data tampering attacks against the optimal computation decisions. We validate the outcomes of our PoE-based secure digital twin-edge network model with extensive evaluations. Since the proposed model distributes the task not only to the local device but also to the MEC and cloud server for delay awareness, it reduces the delay but consumes more energy. Nevertheless, the additional energy consumption can be neglected against the delay reduction. The proposed scheme is also more scalable to compare with the conventional solution. The numerical results clearly show that the proposed model provides energy and delay awareness, maintaining both data integrity and trustworthiness at the same execution of algorithm.",false,2023-10-01,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1570870523001749,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Bozkaya, Elif'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Erel-Özçevik, Müge'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Bilen, Tuğçe'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Özçevik, Yusuf'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1570870523001749'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570870523001749'}]",,application/json,,S1570-8705(23)00174-9,Elsevier B.V.,Proof of Evaluation-based energy and delay aware computation offloading for Digital Twin Edge Network,© 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Most notably, holonic architectures are defined in terms of their world-of-interest (Van Brussel et al., 1998). They do not have an information layer, a communication layer, etc. Instead, they have components that relate to real-world assets (e.g. machine tools) and activities (e.g. assembly). And, they mirror and track the structure of their world-of-interest, which allows them to scale and adapt accordingly. This research has wandered around, at times learning from its mistakes, and progressively carved out an invariant structure while it translated and applied scientific insights from complex-adaptive systems theory (e.g. autocatalytic sets) and from bounded rationality (e.g. holons). This paper presents and discusses the outcome of these research efforts. At the top level, the holonic structure distinguishes intelligent beings (or digital twins) from intelligent agents. These digital twins inherit the consistency from reality, which they mirror. They are intelligent beings when they reflect what exists in the world without imposing artificial limitations in this reality. Consequently, a conflict with a digital twin is a conflict with reality. In contrast, intelligent agents typically transform NP-hard challenges into computations with low-polynomial complexity. Unavoidably, this involves arbitrariness (e.g. don’t care choices). Likewise, relying on case-specific properties, to ensure an outcome in polynomial time, usually renders the validity of an agent’s choices both short-lived and situation-dependent. Here, intelligent agents create conflicts by imposing limitations of their own making in their world-of-interest. Real-world smart systems are aggregates comprising both intelligent beings and intelligent agents. They are performers. Inside these performers, digital twins may constitute the foundations, supporting walls, support beams and pillars because these intelligent beings are protected by their real-world counterpart. Further refining the top-level of this architecture, a holonic structure enables these digital twins to shadow their real-world counterpart whenever it changes, adapts and evolves. In contrast, the artificial limitations, imposed by the intelligent agents, cannot be allowed to build up inertia, which would hamper the undoing of arbitrary or case-specific limitations. To this end, performers explicitly manage the rights over their assets. Revoking such rights from a limitation-imposing agent will free the assets. This will be at the cost of reduced services from the agent. When other service providers rely on this agent, their services may be affected as well; that’s how the inertia builds up and how harmful legacy is created. Thus, the services of digital twins are to be preferred over the services of an intelligent agent by developers of holonic manufacturing systems. Finally, digital twins corresponding to the decision making in the world-of-interest (a non-physical asset) allow to mirror the world-of-interest in a predictive mode (in addition to track and trace). It allows to generate short-term forecasts while preserving the benefits of intelligent beings. These twins are the intentions of the decision-making intelligent agents.

Our motivation behind this move is the ever-growing computerisation in these systems, in the form of complex distributed computing nodes, running complex distributed software. Industrial CPS also demonstrate heavy deployment of hardware sensors, as well as an increasing role for software. We observe the insufficiency and costliness of design-time measures in prevention of anomalies. As our main contribution, our methodology is taking advantage of this data-rich environment by means of Extra-Functional Behaviour (EFB) monitoring, analytics pipelines and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Specifically, we demonstrate the use of compartmentalisation of execution timelines into distinct units, i.e., execution phases. We introduce the generation of representations for these phases, i.e., behavioural signatures and behavioural passports, as our way of behavioural fingerprinting. Composed using regression modelling techniques, signatures as the representation of ongoing behaviour, are compared to passports, representing reference behaviour. The comparison is done by means of goodness-of-fit scores, creating quantifiable measures of deviation between different recorded behaviours. We have used both partially synthetic and real-world traces in our experiments, depending on the use-case. We have also followed both white box and black box approaches for our use-cases, with discussions on the pros and cons of each. The effectiveness of our data-centric methodology is demonstrated by two proofs-of-concept from the industry, to represent the two ends of the industrial CPS complexity spectrum, with one being a large semiconductor photolithography machine, while the other is an image analysis platform. Each use-case comes with its own characteristics and limitations, confirming the flexibility of our methodology and the relevance of its integral steps in the approach towards the initial analysis and data transformations. The results of anomaly classification show overall high accuracies, as high as 99% in certain set-ups.

It brings challenges including reduced efficiency, increased costs and safety issues in power plants. At a component level, load changes of thermal power plants are mainly carried out through actions of control stage systems of steam turbines. Accurate performance monitoring of control stage systems is key to enable faster and more flexible operation of thermal power plants thus provides opportunities to accommodate more renewable power with limited penalty to efficiency and safety. In this paper, a hybrid modelling method based on operation data and first-principle mechanism is proposed for performance monitoring of control stage systems. The hybrid modelling method features a) flow rate calculation of high-pressure control valves with limited measurement data, and b) flow and efficiency characteristics calculation over full working ranges of control stages. The proposed hybrid modelling method is validated via two case studies of a 330 MW subcritical steam turbine and a 1000 MW ultra-supercritical steam turbine, where digital twins of control stages are developed.

CPPSs face different categories of errors. These errors will cause failures of the entire production chain. To handle this concern, production systems should be converted into fault-tolerant production systems. To present such systems, a fault tolerance approach was developed to help possible faults prediction and detection of faults causes in this study. Also, the increasing complexity and uncertainty of CPPS call for Digital Twin (DT)-based fault tolerance approach. The proposes approach uses an extraction module to extract the faults signatures efficiently. Based on all extracted faults, appropriate responses could be generated through reliable faults patterns prediction. This method is provided using Fault Tree Analyzer (FTA), Zero-suppressed Decision Diagram (ZDD), and Support Vector Machine-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (SVM-ANFIS) structure.

To realise this vision of Industry 4.0, one of the main requirements is to achieve interconnectivity across a diverse set of devices [2] and to acquire and integrate large amounts of data which can be used to inform production decisions [3]. However, one of the main challenges in implementing this solution is establishing interoperability with each device, which is primarily associated with a lack of standardisation available [4]. This is a particularly pressing issue as new devices by different manufacturers are continuously being released presenting an ongoing challenge in establishing uniform interoperability. In total there are over 300 platforms for IoT solutions, with new applications continuously being developed [5]. Thus, in this area there are a wide range of platforms, architectures and frameworks [6]. The importance of solving these interoperability challenges have been identified in the Insight report by the World Economic Forum, which outlined the need to resolve these issues not solely at a national level but globally, in order to implement Industry 4.0. To achieve this aim requires the establishment of global standards which is an ongoing task [7]. The focus of this paper is to examine the progress that is being made in order to establish interoperability across a diverse set of systems and also to identify the challenges in establishing this level of interoperability.

The use of digital technologies to manage the reliability of microsystems stems from the development of various modern energy technologies with complex structures that require enhanced management systems to ensure their reliability. In this paper, we propose the use of digital platforms to manage the reliability of microsystems. The way digital platforms function makes it possible to automate the process of collecting, processing, and storing the necessary information about both power equipment and the operating modes of distribution networks and, in so doing, to assess and ensure the reliability of microsystems at all stages of the life cycle. In this paper, we present the main operational characteristics and principles of digital platforms. To analyze the reliability of microsystems within the framework of the functioning of digital platforms, we propose the use of machine learning methods. We suggest two algorithms for assessing the reliability of microsystems.

Therefore, it is interesting to investigate how to facilitate their engineering by using already existing data, namely event logs, and reducing the number of manual steps for their engineering. Current research lacks systematic, automated approaches to derive process-aware digital twin cockpits even though some helpful techniques already exist in the areas of process mining and software engineering. Within this paper, we present a low-code development approach that reduces the amount of hand-written code needed and uses process mining techniques to derive PADTCs. We describe what models could be derived from event log data, which generative steps are needed for the engineering of PADTCs, and how process mining could be incorporated into the resulting application. This process is evaluated using the MIMIC III dataset for the creation of a PADTC prototype for an automated hospital transportation system. This approach can be used for early prototyping of PADTCs as it needs no hand-written code in the first place, but it still allows for the iterative evolvement of the application.

This work presents a real-time digital double framework that improves and facilitates robot perception of the environment. Soft or non-rigid terrains can cause locomotion failures, while visual perception alone is often insufficient to assess the physical properties of such surfaces. To tackle this problem we employ the proposed framework to estimate ground collapsibility through physical interactions while the robot is dynamically walking on challenging terrains. We extract discrepancy information between the two systems, a simulated digital double that is synchronized with a real robot, both using exactly the same physical model and locomotion controller. The discrepancy in sensor measurements between the real robot and its digital double serves as a critical indicator of anomalies between expected and actual motion and is utilized as input to a learning-based model for terrain collapsibility analysis. The performance of the collapsibility estimation was evaluated in a variety of real-world scenarios involving flat, inclined, elevated, and outdoor terrains.

The operational digital twin is designed to solve forward problems given input operation parameters, as well as to solve inverse problems given some observations of the power field. The forward model is non-intrusive and realised using SVD autoencoder reduced order model with the combination of machine learning methods, namely, k-nearest-neighbours and decision trees to build the input–output map. For model parameter estimation, the inverse model is based on a generalised latent assimilation method. The proposed approach is able to make use of the non intrusive reduced order model and the online measurements of the power field. The effectiveness in the sense of accuracy and real-time solver of the digital twin is illustrated through a real engineering problem in nuclear reactor physics — reactor core simulation in the life cycle of HPR1000 affected by input parameters, i.e., control rod inserting step, burnup, power level and inlet temperature of the coolant, which shows potential applications for on-line monitoring purpose.",false,2022-12-15,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306454922004613,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Gong, Helin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Cheng, Sibo'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Chen, Zhang'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Li, Qing'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Quilodrán-Casas, César'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Xiao, Dunhui'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Arcucci, Rossella'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306454922004613'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306454922004613'}]",,application/json,,S0306-4549(22)00461-3,Elsevier Ltd.,An efficient digital twin based on machine learning SVD autoencoder and generalised latent assimilation for nuclear reactor physics,© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

This study compares and quantifies the impact of the different measures in preserving the quality of fresh produce in the cold chain. We employed physics-based digital twins of fresh produce. This digital twin is the virtual representation of fresh produce that can calculate the temperature distribution within the fruit and link these to quality decay based on the measured air temperature data. In this study, 95 shipments were monitored in the cold chain for four fruits (cucumber, eggplant, strawberry, and raspberry) imported from Spain to Switzerland. Using these temperature data as inputs for the digital twins, their hygrothermal response and physiological evolution to evaluate different optimization strategies were simulated. We showed that shortening the time length of shipment by one day at the distribution center resulted in 18% higher fruit quality index for cucumber and eggplant and 60% higher for berries. Lowering the shipment temperature by 5 °C extended the shelf life of strawberry on average by 36% and raspberry by 73%. Lowering the shelf temperature in retail stores by 5 °C prolonged the shelf life of the four fruits, on average, by about 40%, but the reduction is very fruit-dependent. For every 10% increase in relative humidity in the surroundings of unpacked fruit from during transport and at the distribution center by adjusting hygrothermal climate control, mass loss was reduced by 20% for all the studied fruits. Finally, evaporative cooling at the retail stores, which could be done by dry misting, extended the shelf life by more than 60%, due to the induced temperature reduction. Taking advantage of this digital twin's capability to evaluate the different scenarios, we can quantify the impact of cold chain optimizations more efficiently and cost-effectively in the design phase.",false,2022-09-30,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0260877422001315,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Shoji, Kanaha'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Schudel, Seraina'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Shrivastava, Chandrima'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Onwude, Daniel'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Defraeye, Thijs'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0260877422001315'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877422001315'}]",,application/json,Full,S0260-8774(22)00131-5,The Authors.

Informed by the literature on information security management, situational awareness (SA) and common operational picture (COP), we derive an overarching model to provide CCIs’ actors with increased cyber situational awareness, common understanding of incidents and enhanced response capacity. On the practical side, the model seeks to minimize response time and to reduce the impact of cyber-attacks on the organizations and on society as a whole.

Consequently, big data-driven product design focuses mostly on physical data analysis instead of virtual models; in other words, there is no frequent convergence between a product’s virtual and physical space. Recently, the interest in developing a digital twin, which interconnects the real and virtual world, has grown rapidly throughout the world. As Industry 4.0 hypes the power of artificial intelligence embedded into “things,” it neglects the role of the human component, which is still essential in many manufacturing activities, such as machine setup or maintenance. A digital twin of service-oriented manufacturing knowledge was developed, which leverages a flexible ontology-based knowledge structure combined with an augmented reality input system for intuitive, hands-on knowledge retrieval. The autonomous and self-optimizing characteristics of intelligent manufacturing suggest new demands, including learning and cognitive capabilities. Intelligent manufacturing offers enhanced quality, high productivity, low costs, and great flexibility for manufacturers.

Recently, the success of artificial intelligence techniques such as deep learning has led to their adoption in manufacturing and especially in human–robot collaboration. Collaborative manufacturing tasks involving human operators and robots pose significant safety and reliability concerns. In response to these concerns, a deep learning-enhanced Digital Twin framework is introduced through which human operators and robots can be detected and their actions can be classified during the manufacturing process, enabling autonomous decision making by the robot control system. Developed using Unreal Engine 4, our Digital Twin framework complies with the Robotics Operating System specification, and supports synchronous control and communication between the Digital Twin and the physical system. In our framework, a fully-supervised detector based on a faster region-based convolutional neural network is firstly trained on synthetic data generated by the Digital Twin, and then tested on the physical system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Digital Twin-based framework. To ensure safety and reliability, a semi-supervised detector is further designed to bridge the gap between the twin system and the physical system, and improved performance is achieved by the semi-supervised detector compared to the fully-supervised detector that is simply trained on either synthetic data or real data. The evaluation of the framework in multiple scenarios in which human operators collaborate with a Universal Robot 10 shows that it can accurately detect the human and robot, and classify their actions under a variety of conditions. The data from this evaluation have been made publicly available, and can be widely used for research and operational purposes.

In manufacturing stand point, digitalization brings influence to productivity and secures sustainable growth. The complexities in managing bottleneck and equipment efficiency in semiconductor manufacturer are increasing dynamically. This paper addresses the approach and case studies by a semiconductor manufacturing company managing its line performance in digitalization era. Manufacturing experts are from cross functional departments- from planning, operation to equipment maintenance divisions and they support various methods and strategies in handling complexity of product mix. The main Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is set in a way that ensures manufactured products are delivered on time with high quality. Prediction towards manufacturing line performance while supporting dynamic market demands are challenging. The production experts have the challenge to predict the future line performance just by self-experienced or human handling manual data study in analyzing historical performance. Foreseen the current and future needs, the company operation research and engineering team introduce work-in - progress (WIP) flow simulation solution in digital twin platform to provide solution for production. This paper discusses how the model’s framework is supported with computer programming and mathematic logics. Simulation team is responsible to maintain the functionality of this model and proposed solutions for manufacturing stakeholders making a strategic decision. This simulation model functions as a forecaster to provide prediction key figures such as flow factor, work-in progress (WIP) status and equipment utilization which applicable within short term and long term views depending on different demand scenarios. Projection towards equipment maintenance status such as equipment uptime can be validated upfront through the inputs from this model. Besides assisting the stakeholders in making a strategic decision in managing bottleneck, the simulation model supports to forecast manufacturing line performance when equipment preventive maintenance activities are scheduled to be performed at specified period; in parallel, assists the managers to plan resources such as manpower and materials. The simulation forecaster model also helps the manufacturing planner to analyze the gap on the actual capacity requirement with the original capacity plan in supporting the market demand. Results from several case studies from the simulation model would convince this organization’s stakeholders that the digitalization through simulation model approach would improve manufacturing line performance and benefits the organization in its internal supply chain management.",false,2019-12-31,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920301578,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Misrudin, Farhain'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Foong, Lee Ching'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920301578'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920301578'}]",,application/json,Full,S2351-9789(20)30157-8,The Author(s).

One important feature of processing data is the identification of trust in both the underlying data and processed information that arises from the data. Trust, as it is defined here, will typically be built from several contributory sources. While there are both quantitative and qualitative sources of trust, this paper focuses on the qualitative aspects of trust via the transparency of the algorithmic process that is available in the crystal-box modelling. The crystal-box idea is also extended to include the concept of a ‘crystal-box workflow’. The key idea is that in order to assist the user of the digital twin to interpret the results they are presented with, via the digital twin interface, the information needs to be contextualised. This work shows an example of how this can be done for a vibration testing (specifically modal testing) example on a scaled three-storey structure. The information is contextualised for the user via ‘profiles’, which collate and augment the processed information together. In particular, synthetic results are generated in order to augment a limited set of physically recorded data, and these synthetic results are then used to assist the user in contextualising the physically recorded data.

The results demonstrate that the adaptability of the transportation system to uncertain events and its response and recovery measures taken are reflected to some extent in the traveler behavior model. Besides, data sharing between vehicles and infrastructure in the transportation network can be well solved by Digital Twins Blockchain. The locally-aware multi-intelligent body algorithm saves more than 50% communication overhead and improves operational efficiency by nearly 20% over traditional algorithms by increasing intelligent body infrastructure units. It is adequately suited for large-scale vehicle traffic twins. It can be seen that improving the resilience of Digital Twins is a very obvious change in the adaptability of the traffic system.",false,2023-07-31,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0965856423001064,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Feng, Hailin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Lv, Haibin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Lv, Zhihan'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0965856423001064'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856423001064'}]",,application/json,Full,S0965-8564(23)00106-4,The Author(s).

Digital twin is an ingenious concept that helps on organizing different areas of expertise aiming at supporting engineering decisions related to a specific asset; it articulates computational models, sensors, learning, real time analysis, diagnosis, prognosis, and so on. In this framework, and to leverage its capacity, we explore the integration of physics-based models with machine learning. A digital twin is constructed for a damaged structure, where a discrete physics-based computational model is employed to investigate several damage scenarios. A machine learning classifier, that serves as the digital twin, is trained with data taken from a stochastic computational model. This strategy allows the use of an interpretable model (physics-based) to build a fast digital twin (machine learning) that will be connected to the physical twin to support real time engineering decisions. Different classifiers (quadratic discriminant, support vector machines, etc) are tested, and different model parameters (number of sensors, level of noise, damage intensity, uncertainty, operational parameters, etc) are considered to construct datasets for the training. The accuracy of the digital twin depends on the scenario analyzed. Through the chosen application, we are able to emphasize each step of a digital twin construction, including the possibility of integrating physics-based models with machine learning. The different scenarios explored yield conclusions that might be helpful for a large range of applications.",false,2021-06-16,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0888327021000091,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Ritto, T.G.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Rochinha, F.A.'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0888327021000091'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327021000091'}]",,application/json,,S0888-3270(21)00009-1,Elsevier Ltd.,"Digital twin, physics-based model, and machine learning applied to damage detection in structures",© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

A bibliometric search was performed on 197 papers that were obtained from the Scopus database. 151 of those papers were used in the subsequent scientometric analysis and mapping to narrate the evolution of the research subject. The studies discussed in the paper cover a wide range of research from model-based information management to building information management, all the way to the interaction between buildings and smart cities. The ‘virtual-physical building integration’, ‘building lifecycle management’, and ‘information integrated production’ subjects are highly in the focus of the research field.

To achieve this, various dynamic simulation data was collected from a high-fidelity model to calibrate the performance of a low fidelity model. The advantageous computational speed of low fidelity models makes it possible to quickly analyze various faulty conditions for the system. As the system degrades, the natural frequencies of the vibration deviate thus leading to potential resonance and system failure. In comparing the faulty system’s response to the healthy case, an optimal sensor position is located.",false,2022-12-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405896322001847,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Bondoc, Andrew E.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Tayefeh, Mohsen'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Barari, Ahmad'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405896322001847'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896322001847'}]",,application/json,,S2405-8963(22)00184-7,", IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.",Employing LIVE Digital Twin in Prognostic and Health Management: Identifying Location of the Sensors,"© 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.",0,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Digital Twin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Smart Inspection'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Prognostics'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'health management'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Predictive maintenance'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Prescriptive Maintenance'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Smart Maintenance'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Industry 4.0'}]",false,IFAC-PapersOnLine,,138-143,143,fla,2022,10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.04.183,138,doi:10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.04.183,,24058963,55,2,2,"14th IFAC Workshop on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems IMS 2022- Tel-Aviv, Israel, 28-30 March 2022",,

However, the current seam detection method is vulnerable to complex laser environments, such as illumination interference and material defects, thereby limiting the application of active light coaxial visual sensors in seam tracking. This paper proposes a seam detection and calibration method based on an active light coaxial visual sensor in a laser welding digital twin environment. First, a vision sensor with an 808 nm auxiliary illumination and a customized lens are mounted on the laser welding head to filter out noises and capture the welding image, including the seam and melt pool. Next, a seam information extraction approach based on image processing algorithms is designed to extract seam position and seam width. In addition, an artificial neural network based Kalman filter is proposed to eliminate measurement errors and reduce measurement noise. The calibration of the seam detection parameters is a tedious process. Therefore, the calibration problem is transformed into an optimization problem. A genetic algorithm-based calibration method is proposed to automatically determine the optimum parameters of the seam detection algorithm. Finally, seam detection experiments on laser welding are conducted in both the digital twin environment and the laser welding system. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more efficient than the Hough transfer-based seam detection method.

They are also valued for their stiffness properties, particularly in the case of suspension design. The behavior of these materials is complex, making it challenging to accurately incorporate them into simulations. If the dependence of dynamic properties on frequency and temperature has been commonly investigated, other phenomena still need to be studied, as for instance nonlinear phenomena leading to changes with the magnitude of stress/strain. Amongst them, the Payne effect, which manifests itself by a monotonous decrease of the storage modulus, remains difficult to integrate in the simulations, and is not often characterized experimentally for vibration purposes. An approach is proposed to identify the Payne effect by combining tests derived from the Oberst beam set-up and numerical simulations. To take into account the uncertainties inherent to the experiments, the identification process is based on a Bayesian identification framework which allows to determine the parameters and their statistical properties from a limited number of experimental measurements. The coupling between the Bayesian identification of dynamic properties of a polymer sample and a digital twin of the experimental set-up allows to identify the evolution of the storage modulus as a function of the strain amplitude, as well as the confidence interval around the mean value. The application on a silicone sample confirmed the decrease of the modulus with the strain level, with a good confidence level.

Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twin-driven virtual commissioning method to simulate the machining processes in a virtual environment and perform virtual commissioning to obtain better commissioning results. Firstly, a digital twin model is constructed using a multi-domain unified modeling language combined with a virtual-real mapping strategy to describe the response characteristics of CNCMTs. Secondly, a complex machining scene is simulated based on the twin model, and a virtual commissioning strategy and platform are constructed in this environment. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by taking the spindle system of CNCMTs as an example.

Digitalization may be seen as the increased generation, analysis, and use of data to improve the efficiency of the overall manufacturing system. Simulation in manufacturing is often applied in situations where conducting experiments on a real system is impossible or very difficult due to cost or time to carry out the experiment is too long. A key input to the simulation model of automated equipment is the acquisition of valid data in relation to cycle time and reliability of various workstations on this line. As a consequence of being able to simulate equipment processes and interact with this validated simulation model, both the understanding of how the production system will perform under varying reliability and cycle time conditions is achieved. The simulation model then enables the experimentation of ‘what if scenarios’ that can be tested easily, while also providing a valuable tool to inform the maintenance personnel what station reliabilities they need to target in order to sustain a high performing manufacturing line. Simulation metamodeling is an approach to line design which is of great interest to design engineers and research experts. However, its application in automated medical devices manufacturing line design has never been well explored. The author has adopted an open-source simulation tool (JaamSim) to develop a digital model of an automated medical devices manufacturing line in the Johnson & Johnson Vision Care (JJVC) manufacturing facility. This paper demonstrates with a high level of rigour, fidelity and overall system design/approach, how a digital model along with the use of a metamodel can be used for the development of an automated manufacturing line in the medical devices industry. The digital model and metamodel can be used by manufacturing engineering teams to perform scenario testing during the design and development phase of the line or as part of the continuous improvement stage when the line is in full operation. The overall average absolute error when comparing the simulation model outputs to the metamodel outputs was 0.87% was achieved with the metamodel for the actual industrial application used by the author.",false,2022-10-31,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278612522001820,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Ruane, Patrick'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Walsh, Patrick'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Cosgrove, John'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278612522001820'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612522001820'}]",,application/json,Full,S0278-6125(22)00182-0,The Author(s).

The boiler is generally operated in the range of 40–100 MW using two of five burner levels. In order to optimize boiler performance, we propose the implementation of a unique digital twin. Our digital twin abstraction couples Bayesian inference from science-based models and from observations (machine learning) with decision theory to predict operating-variable set points that optimize the physical asset (the boiler) in the presence of uncertainty (artificial intelligence). We focus this paper on the continuous Bayesian machine learning part of the Atikokan Digital Twin; we discuss decision theory in a companion paper. We identify and learn about 12 operational, model, and measured-output parameters and their uncertainties from high-fidelity, science-based simulations of the Atikokan boiler and from the observed measurements at the power plant. Since the goal of the Atikokan Digital Twin is to implement it online in real time, we require fast function evaluations for the quantities of interest extracted from the simulations in the Bayesian analysis. We use Gaussian process regression/interpolation to create accurate, robust surrogate models. We define the Bayesian priors and likelihood function and solve for the posterior distributions of the 12 parameters. We then propagate these distributions (i.e., parameters with uncertainty) into the predicted distributions of 790 quantities of interest to learn about the relative importance of various sources of error including experimental, model, and operating-parameter errors.",false,2022-03-15,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306261921016627,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Spinti, Jennifer P.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Smith, Philip J.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Smith, Sean T.'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306261921016627'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921016627'}]",,application/json,,S0306-2619(21)01662-7,Elsevier Ltd.,Atikokan Digital Twin: Machine learning in a biomass energy system,© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

These are accepted as key elements when holistically assessing naval platform survivability against threat scenarios. Conversely, traditional naval platform survivability assessment only considered the vulnerability domain or a combination of susceptibility and vulnerability. However, emphasis is now placed on the interdependence of susceptibility, vulnerability and recoverability. Unfortunately, there are shortcomings with historic survivability modelling and assessment capabilities pertaining to Integrated Survivability. This has resulted in the need to clearly define the concept of Integrated Survivability, and identify modelling requirements to assess platforms exposed to the threat environments. A naval platform Integrated Survivability assessment capability, derived from those survivability modelling requirements, will enable naval architects and mission planners to quantify the effects of platform survivability. Assessments will consider platform safety systems and survivability control measures, and changes to those systems and control measures. Outcomes from the assessments will contribute to platform configuration optimisation for resilience against the threat environment and enable mission success.

However, the current intelligent lighting system generally adopts independent sensor control and does not perform multi-source heterogeneous data fusion with other digital systems. This paper fully considers the linkage between the lighting system and the surveillance system and proposes a digital twin lighting (DTL) system that mainly consists of three parts. Firstly, a visualized operation and maintenance (VO&M) platform for a DTL system was established based on dynamic BIM. Secondly, the environment perception, key-frame similarity judgment, and multi-channel key-frame cut and merge mechanism were utilized to preprocess the video stream of the surveillance system in real-time. Lastly, pedestrians detected using YOLOv4 and the ambient brightness perceived by the environment perception mechanism were transmitted to the cloud database and were continuously read by the VO&M platform. The intent here was to aid timely adaptive adjustment of the digital twin and realistic lighting through the internet. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by experimenting with a surveillance video stream for 14 days. The key results of the experiments are as follows: (1) the accuracy rate of intelligent decision control reached 95.15%; (2) energy consumption and electricity costs were reduced by approximately 79%; and (3) the hardware cost and energy consumption of detection equipment and the time and cost of operation and maintenance (O&M) were greatly reduced.",false,2022-09-01,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037877882200442X,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Tan, Yi'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Chen, Penglu'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Shou, Wenchi'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Sadick, Abdul-Manan'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037877882200442X'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037877882200442X'}]",,application/json,,S0378-7788(22)00442-X,Elsevier B.V.,Digital Twin-driven approach to improving energy efficiency of indoor lighting based on computer vision and dynamic BIM,© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Background While the application and deployment of eHealth has continued at a rapid pace, healthcare professionals are expected to keep up and join the digital evolution. The implementation of eHealth requires a change in the healthcare professionals’ competencies of which the ability to adapt to technological change is fundamental. There’s more needed than just ICT skills, overall competencies to be digitally adaptable between patientcare and the use of eHealth are needed. Today, a distinct and relevant list of items for healthcare professionals related to the competency of digital adaptability is missing. Design An exploratory modified e-Delphi study. Methods This study was conducted in Flanders, Belgium. An expert group (n = 12) consisting of 2 policymakers of the Belgian federal government, 3 eHealth managers of large organizations in the Belgian healthcare sector, 1 nurse, 1 midwife, 2 health service users and 3 researchers specialized in eHealth research. Through a literature review an initial list of items was developed, consisting of 67 statements. A two-round Delphi survey was performed where experts could rate the relevance of each item. The third round comprised an online meeting, where the expert group discussed the remaining items until agreement was reached to retain, modify, or eliminate the item. Results In round 1, eleven items were included to the final document. In round 2, ten items were included. In round 3, the panel unanimously agreed to add six items, one item was modified into two separate items. In total, 29 items were included in the final document.

Over time, LNAPL components are depleted and those partitioning to various phases change, as do those available for biodegradation. To accommodate these processes and predict trends and NSZD over decades to centuries, for the first time, we incorporated a multi-phase multi-component multi-microbe non-isothermal approach to representatively simulate NSZD at field scale.

By combining measurement and computational data, this paper presents a digital twin-based structural health monitoring framework of physical assets. The process for building the measurement-computation combined digital twin (MCC-DT) involves four steps. First, an artificial intelligence-driven load identification method combining measurement and computational data is employed to recognize the loads applied on physical assets. Two approaches were proposed to realize load identification, based on single fidelity surrogate models and deep learning techniques, respectively. Second, multi-fidelity surrogate (MFS) models are applied to improve the accuracy in the MCC-DT. Two routes for implementing the MFS models are introduced and the advantages and shortcomings of both are analyzed. Third, an online rainflow counting algorithm is developed to calculate the degradation of the physical assets.

By combining measurement and computational data, this paper presents a digital twin-based structural health monitoring framework of physical assets. The process for building the measurement-computation combined digital twin (MCC-DT) involves four steps. First, an artificial intelligence-driven load identification method combining measurement and computational data is employed to recognize the loads applied on physical assets. Two approaches were proposed to realize load identification, based on single fidelity surrogate models and deep learning techniques, respectively. Second, multi-fidelity surrogate (MFS) models are applied to improve the accuracy in the MCC-DT. Two routes for implementing the MFS models are introduced and the advantages and shortcomings of both are analyzed. Third, an online rainflow counting algorithm is developed to calculate the degradation of the physical assets. The main advantage of the algorithm is that it can provide a near real-time estimation for the damage accumulated of physical assets.

Drawing on the dynamic capability view, this study aims at exploring the relationship among supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDCs), supply chain integration (SCI), supply chain resilience (SCR), sustainable competitive advantage (SCA), and sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP). The study collected 325 usable responses from healthcare supply chain organizations in the developing country of Pakistan, including hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturing firms, surgical and equipment manufacturing firms, etc. Structural equation modeling using Smart-PLS v.3.3.2 was adopted for the data analysis. The results indicate that SCDCs positively influence SCI, SCR, SCA, and SSCP. This study finds that SCA, SCI, and SCR mediate the relationship between SCDCs and SSCP. This study contributes by aligning the SC dynamic capabilities for supply chain visibilities (i.e., sensing, learning, and coordinating) in the healthcare context. It has examined the impacts of SCDC, SCI, and SCR collectively rather than addressing them piecemeal. Sensing, learning, and coordinating capabilities through frequent collaborative meetings offer healthcare firms SC integration, allowing them to respond to the changing environment quickly and resiliently, further improving their SCA and SSCP.

Maintaining high predictive capability of a digital twin model is of great concern to the engineers who make design decisions at the early stages of product development.

The proposed digital twin approach can be used in a variety of product development settings. The proposed idea takes advantage of hybrid digital twin approaches, using both data-driven and physics-based approaches. The proposed approach is based on two techniques; (i) statistical model calibration and (ii) probabilistic element updating. In statistical model calibration, statistical parameters of input variables are estimated. Further, probabilistic analysis using estimated statistical parameters can predict possible critical elements. In probabilistic element updating procedures, the possible crack initiation and growth element is updated. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated using a case study of an automotive sub-frame fatigue test.

Robot arms are one of the most common devices utilised in manufacturing and industrial processes, used for a wide variety of automation tasks on, for example, a factory floor but the effective use of these devices requires AI to be appropriately trained. One approach to support AI training of these devices is the use of a “Digital Twin”. There are, however, a number of challenges that exist within this domain, in particular, success depends upon the ability to collect data of what are considered as observations within the environment and the application of one or many trained AI policies to the task that is to be completed. This project presents a case-study of creating and training a Robot Arm Digital Twin as an approach for AI training in a virtual space and applying this simulation learning within physical space. A virtual space, created using Unity (a contemporary Game Engine), incorporating a virtual robot arm was linked to a physical space, being a 3D printed replica of the virtual space and robot arm. These linked environments were applied to solve a task and provide training for an AI model. The contribution of this work is to provide guidance on training protocols for a digital twin together with details of the necessary architecture to support effective simulation in a virtual space through the use of Tensorflow and hyperparameter tuning.

This increased rate of use of direct digital manufacturing to produce commercial products takes place within the backdrop of the major societal challenge of climate change. There is now an increased realization of the need to make wider use of sustainable materials in the manufacturing of products with a much -reduced carbon foot print. It is very challenging to develop a universal approach to the digitalization of Material Science given the broad range of materials in use and the realization that the properties and performance of a material not only critically depend on its chemical composition but also on the distribution of those atomic elements in the microstructure of the material and the texture of the microstructure. Although there are promising developments with simulations of metal alloys and polymers, there is no method which is available for such material optimization to be incorporated and automated in the work stream of direct digital manufacturing. This paper is focused on the development of a structure which enables the integration of the processes of material synthesis, characterization, material optimization, product design and fabrication into a single automated work flow. We introduce the concept of morphology or property optimization. We explore how we can use this approach to optimize the complete manufacturing process from synthesis to fabrication to yield high value products with new designs closely linked to the spatially resolved digital specification of the material.

This makes automated requirement engineering and Model-based-Systems Engineering of medical devices very challenging. The implemented intelligent software service meets these challenges for product design in the healthcare sector.",false,2022-12-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405896322014021,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Maleki, Samira'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Jazdi, Nasser'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Ashtari, Behrang'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405896322014021'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896322014021'}]",,application/json,,S2405-8963(22)01402-1,", IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.",Intelligent Digital Twin in Health Sector: Realization of a Software-Service for Requirements- and Model-based-Systems-Engineering,"© 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.",0,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Digital Twin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'intelligent Digital Twin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Software service'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Requirements-Engineering'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Model-based-Systems-Engineering'}]",false,IFAC-PapersOnLine,,79-84,84,fla,2022,10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.09.187,79,doi:10.1016/j.ifacol.2022.09.187,,24058963,55,19,19,"5th IFAC Workshop on Advanced Maintenance Engineering, Services and Technologies AMEST 2022- Bogotá, Colombia, July 26 – 29, 2022",,

Acoustic signals, which are known for their distinct temporal characteristics, play a pivotal role in the online assessment of weld quality. This study proposes a novel filter bank specifically tailored for robotic welding and investigates the working environment of robot welding. Twenty-six time-domain and frequency-domain features were extracted from weld acoustic signals, and statistical analyses and comparative methods were used to identify variations in defective signal features and interpret their physical significance. By leveraging these acoustic signal characteristics, this study established a predictive identification model and an online feedback controller. The predictive identification model effectively identified different penetration levels in the welding process, and the identification results served as a reference input for online regulation of the welding speed by the controller. Additionally, a digital twin system was developed, where the identification model and controller functioned as digital objects on a computer and an edge computer, respectively. Experimental tests demonstrated the superior performance of the system and model in accurately reflecting welding process penetration, regulating and stabilising the welding speed, and significantly enhancing the welding quality.

In recent years, deep learning approaches have shown great potential for detecting and diagnosing faults in induction motors. However, it was observed that the convolutional neural network (CNN) might miss the crucial long-range temporal dependencies of the significant features. At the same time, the recursive neural network (RNN) may face issues such as vanishing gradient and less computational efficiency if the data is too long with complex patterns. This paper proposes a novel deep-learning model that combines a one-dimensional CNN and an RNN into two independent pipelines. The spatial, temporal, long-term, and short-term features can be extracted from the raw input signal. A multi-head mechanism, a state-of-the-art deep learning technique in natural language processing (NLP), enables the model to focus more on relevant features and prevent overfitting. Specifically, our method simplifies the conventional fault diagnosis workflow while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to several state-of-the-art methods. By leveraging the ability to detect faults directly from raw, unprocessed electrical signals, our approach offers a practical, cost-effective solution for real-time fault detection in industrial applications.

Product redesign is widely required in the process of product improvement, which is greatly depends on the functional analysis of product. Although traditional functional analysis can identify product design problems, the analyzed information is extremely detailed and verbose, which hinders the opportunity of product innovation. To expand the solution space for improving the innovation chance and ensuring solution quality of the product in the physical space, a digital twin is introduced in the redesign process. This study proposes a product redesign method using the functional backtrack obtained from a relational function model (RFM) to the hierarchical function model (HFM) with the digital twin. Based on a selected target product, the proposed method constructs the product RFM (sub-field) that originates from the reverse fishbone and relationships between components. Related parameters of components are obtained. A digital twin entity is built using the RFM (sub-field) and parameters based on the target physical product, and functions are extracted in the form of “verb + noun.” The RFM is formed considering four relations between functions. Furthermore, functions in the RFM are divided into various levels using the Dempster–Shafer theory based on functional levels and boundaries. In addition, the HFM is formed to indicate the level of problem functions and range area of the solution space. Components and parameters of harmful functions are obtained based on the digital twin entity. Creative ideas of product redesign are generated using the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) to solve inventive problems at different functional levels. Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is introduced to evaluate and select solutions.

City information models (CIM), urban digital twin (UDT), and the proliferation of communication technologies have transformed the way society operates and has led to the modernisation of traditional methods of inclusive decision-makings. However, creating a CIM that effectively aligns the diverse interests and capabilities of (non-expert) users like local inhabitants for active participation can be challenging. In this study, we aim to develop a virtual CIM and explore the immersive behaviours of (non-expert) users in the context of community design and policy decision-making. To do this, we use a combination of multi-objective programming and mixed-media prototyping to create the CIM, which includes LOD 300 spatial representation, what-if scenario implementation, geo-tagging feedback, and easy communication and exploration by stakeholders. The virtual CIM was tested in a real-life urban community design exercise in The Netherlands, the Blue Zone Malvalaan, in two phases by both expert and non-expert stakeholders. We evaluated the user experience through quantitative and qualitative data analysis, focusing on ease-of-use, usefulness, immersion, mental and physical comfort, and satisfaction.

This paper proposes a CPMT Platform based on OPC UA and MTConnect that enables standardized, interoperable and efficient data communication among machine tools and various types of software applications. First, a development method for OPC UA-based CPMT is proposed based on a generic OPC UA information model for CNC machine tools. Second, to address the issue of interoperability between OPC UA and MTConnect, an MTConnect to OPC UA interface is developed to transform MTConnect information model and its data to their OPC UA counterparts. An OPC UA-based CPMT prototype is developed and further integrated with a previously developed MTConnect-based CPMT to establish a common CPMT Platform. Third, different applications are developed to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed CPMT Platform, including an OPC UA Client, an advanced AR-assisted wearable Human-Machine Interface and a conceptual framework for CPMT powered cloud manufacturing environment.

Various operations of O&G are fault-intolerant and real-time in nature that needs a swift response and precise decisions to be efficient and safe. Numerous smart IoT devices (e.g., sensors, pumps, actuators, and gateways) are being utilized in the smart O&G to automate different manual operations of this industry and turning it to be unmanned. Hence, large volumes of valuable data are constantly generated from these smart sensors and controllers. By utilizing these data, significant insights can be derived that can help the O&G to be a thriving and environment-friendly industry. The potentials of advanced computing technologies can be realized across various sectors of O&G. This chapter provides an overarching view of the smart O&G industry and lays the foundation for the following chapters. In particular, in this chapter, we first identify the challenges and objectives of the smart O&G industry.

Related studies also focused on the interaction between temporal and semantic models, but there are still challenges in the two-way sharing of knowledge in the runtime of the temporal model. In this paper, the Semantic Petri Net (SPN) is proposed as a method to represent the temporal states and rules in RDF and SPARQL so that a runnable temporal model can be implemented on a common SPARQL engine, and the state change rules can be checked with access to the rich domain knowledge provided by the semantic web.

This material should be annealed before use because of the residual stress generated inside the silicon steel strip during production. The temperature evaluation of the 3D coil core is important to its annealing quality, but this temperature cannot be measured easily and the prediction method is seldom mentioned in the open literature. A numerical model, which considers the anisotropic heat conduction inside the 3D coil core and convection and radiation heat transfers inside the furnace, is built to link the temperature of furnace with the temperature of 3D coil core. Monte Carlo method is used to calculate the view factors between surfaces in the furnace. Thermal radiation resistance network method is used to obtain radiant heat flux. A computational fluid dynamics model is established to predict the convection heat transfer coefficient. The finite volume method is used to solve the anisotropic conduction inside the 3D coil core, wherein radiant heat flux and convection heat transfer coefficient serve as boundary conditions. The model considers the effects of size, position, location, orientation, and number of 3D coil cores on the temperature evolution. Onsite experiments verify that this digital model is precise in practical application, and the typical simulation error is less than ±2.5%.

The objective of this presentation is to provide an overview of the obstacles to Digital Transformation for the process discipline and explain how these can be overcome. A special emphasis will be given on the role of the process simulation tool (white box modelling) as a catalyst for transformational change. The presentation will examine several challenges specific to process engineering: 1) Process simulators are divided into single-purpose point solutions. Separate models may be created for process design, control strategy design, operator training simulation, performance monitoring and online optimization. 2) Process simulators are typically poorly integrated into engineering workflows beyond the process world, and if so, with a single directional information flow. 3) Legacy process simulators are overloaded with niche features and functions only usable by experts. 4) The potential benefits of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for process engineering are not widely understood. Industry stakeholders see the Digital Twin as the most important building block for Digital Transformation of the process industries. While legacy simulators are well-suited to accurately simulate processes, their decades-old architectures mean they are not ideal to serve the entire plant lifecycle and support the Digital Transformation.

Existing digital twin modeling methods are mainly realized through deploying several modules, including a physical module, a virtual module, a service module, a data module, and a connection module. However, the assembly environment of the aircraft assembly process is complex and challenging to manage. These methods do not provide the data flow and the intrinsic interaction between modules. As a consequence, a digital thread-based modeling digital twin (DTDT) framework with five modules is established in this paper, which takes advantage of both the digital twin and digital thread. Benefited by better data management, the DTDT framework would be conducive to the controllability and traceability of the manufacturing process and product quality. The key characteristics of products, process parameters, and equipment operation conditions, are stored in the database module. And then, the digital thread module will link the entity module and virtual module together by building the directed graph, in which interfaces are provided to the system services module for the process monitoring and processing quality prediction. Finally, the implementation of the DTDT framework is shown through a case of the drilling and riveting process in aircraft assembly.

Clearly, the proliferation of IoT devices contributes to the possibility of digital twins. Furthermore, as IoT devices improve, digital twin might be incorporated in smaller and less sophisticated products, providing significant benefits to businesses.",false,2023-12-31,,EBook,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323992053000109,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Nalini, M.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Bharathkumar, M.R.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Keerthivasan, R.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Nithyashree, N.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Dhanashree, V.'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323992053000109'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323992053000109'}]",9780323992053,application/json,,B978-0-323-99205-3.00010-9,Elsevier Inc.,Chapter 10 Impact of internet of things and digital twin on manufacturing era,Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

The product data should be managed in the associated Digital Twin in order to gain information along the product life cycle and to use this information in upstream development processes. In this way, central product information, consistent product models and holistic information flows can be implemented. In this paper, the potential of integrating Digital Twin data as product information in early stages is investigated. By defining requirements, an approach for an information management system for the product life cycle with Digital Twins is created. The novelty of the approach lies in the information model in the form of an UML class diagram. For this purpose, system properties, information flows and communication properties are considered. Using an exemplary data set, the concept is implemented as a Digital assistance system and validated using the case study of a 3D printer. Finally, returning production and usage information into product design holds potential for cost and resource savings.",false,2023-12-31,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212827123000343,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Arnemann, Lars'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Winter, Sven'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Quernheim, Niklas'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Grieser, Pascal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Anderl, Reiner'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Schleich, Benjamin'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212827123000343'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827123000343'}]",,application/json,Full,S2212-8271(23)00034-3,The Author(s).

Digital systems have been applied over many decades to assist in process safety management throughout the lifecycle of a process plant. There has been much hype in recent years regarding Industry 4.0, digitalization and digital twins regarding the transformative potential that exists within these technologies to improve operational performance and reduce process safety accidents. In this article, a fundamental systems thinking approach is applied to the implementation of the digital twin within the process industries. The importance of having a standardized language and ontology, such as ISO15926, enables the use of reasoning engines and the ability to interconnect models and systems across the process and product lifecycle. We discuss use-cases and forms of the digital twin to improve safety within the process industries. A specific focus shows how an operator training simulator and its embedded dynamic models are applied within this environment.

The framework can improve safety demonstrations with a lifecycle perspective and one-to-one twinning if the values of the framework are realizable. For selecting a suitable interfacing strategy, the paper proposes five performance criteria to preserve the framework’s values while interfacing the controller logic with a digital twin. The paper introduces a safety-critical case study, thereby establishing reasoning, literature, and simulation testing of the interfacing strategies regarding relevant interfacing considerations and the performance criteria. We recommend using behavioral models during the design of FPGA firmware and commercial tools for verification against a reference model during the synthesizing steps. For the final development stage, we propose an FPGA-based digital twin, which offers high computational speed, scalability for integration testing, and comprehensive testing of the digital logical circuits.

The bibliometric analysis used as the method, compared to conventional literature reviews, reduces the likelihood of subjective judgments. The methodology used is based on a set of five research questions. To answer these, bibliographic coupling is used to analyze the publications datasets, specifically, co-citation networks, co-authorship networks, and the co-occurrence map of keywords. This review contributes to the field in raising awareness of the knowledge composition of BIM, GIS, and Web integration in the last decade, dominant research topics, the most recent trends, and the most pressing issues and use cases analyzed in the current studies related to BIM, GIS, and Web integration, thus identifying gaps and defining future research areas on the topic. The research shows that the number of developments focusing on BIM, GIS and Web integration has been continuously growing with a sudden increase after 2016.

A large numerical database, containing 533 fire scenarios with varying fire sizes, positions, and number of fire sources, is established to train a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) neural network. The proposed fire digital twin is demonstrated and validated in a full-scale fire test room (26 m2). Results show that the AI engine successfully identify the fire information by learning the spatial-temporal features of the temperature data with a relative error of less than 15% and a delay time of less than 1 s.

The increase in supply-side energy production is one method of alleviating peak demand proposed by a few investigations. As peak loads last for a short time, additional installations might be required. In addition, facilities that store energy can be used to reduce peak demand. As a consequence of the previous investigation, interruptible load regulation was not taken into account in optimizing system performance. The regulation of interruptible loads can greatly reduce system peak loads in smart city and within the concept of microgrids (MGs). The study proposes an interruptible load scheduling (ILS) scheme that considers consumer subsidy rates with the goal of reducing the peak load of the MG and its operating prices. To this end, a digital twin is developed in which the consumer interruption load time and minimal per-day load decrease restrictions have been completely met in the scheme. The ILS model is solved using a combination of the Min-Conflict Algorithm and the Gray Wolf Optimization Algorithm. Furthermore, simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the suggested algorithm and the show the substantial benefits of the scheme in reducing peak loads and operating prices in smart cities.",false,2023-10-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0038092X23004991,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Yang, Huiwu'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Zhang, Suogen'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Zeng, Jinsheng'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Tang, Shengcai'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Xiong, Shunbin'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0038092X23004991'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X23004991'}]",,application/json,,S0038-092X(23)00499-1,Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Solar Energy Society.,Future of sustainable renewable-based energy systems in smart city industry: Interruptible load scheduling perspective,© 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Solar Energy Society.,0,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Peak load'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'User subsidy rate'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Digital twin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Smart city'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Interruptible load scheduling'}]",false,Solar Energy,,111866,,fla,October 2023,10.1016/j.solener.2023.111866,111866,doi:10.1016/j.solener.2023.111866,,0038092X,263,,,,111866,

The considered object classes include electrical elements (light switch, light, speaker, socket, elevator button), safety elements (emergency switch, smoke alarm, fire extinguisher, escape sign), plumbing system elements (pipes), and other objects with useful information (door sign, board). Semantic information like class labels is extracted by applying AI-based image segmentation and then mapped to the 3D point cloud, segmenting the point cloud into point clusters. We subsequently fit geometric primitives to the point clusters and extract text information by AI-based text detection and recognition. The final output of our proposed method is an information-rich digital twin of buildings that contains geometric information, semantic information such as object categories and useful text information which is valuable in many aspects, like condition monitoring, facility maintenance and management.

Specifically, new advances in sensing technologies have pushed the research of large sensor networks to monitor complex mechanical structures. Given the need for health state monitoring, designing an optimal sensor framework with accurate detectability of failure modes has great significance. However, there is often little to no experimental data available for newly proposed mechanical systems; so a digital-twin method would make fault detection feasible for this applications. In this paper, a data-driven reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) approach is employed for sensor placement and fault detection of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), which is a relatively new system for high power engineering applications. This system suffers from inter-turn and inter-phase short-winding faults, which can cause catastrophic failure of the whole structure. For PMSMs, current sensing and magnetic field sensing can be utilized for the detection of faults, but actual sensor placement has not been considered in recent literature. In this study, the first step is to create an FEA model of the PMSM for the simulation of faults, which serves as the digital twin. Next, a data-driven approach is implemented for sensor placement and classification of faults. The proposed method utilizes distance clustering for identification of various failure modes, which is suitable for many applications due to its high accuracy and computational efficiency. In addition, a genetic algorithm is implemented to determine the minimum number and optimal placement of sensors. This framework simultaneously searches for the optimal placement of sensors while training the classifier for detectability of system health states. Ultimately, the proposed methodology shows convergence to a solution with high accuracy for detection of faults, and is demonstrated on the novel system of a PMSM with magnetic field sensors.",false,2024-02-29,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0951832023006282,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Kohtz, Sara'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Zhao, Junhan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Renteria, Anabel'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Lalwani, Anand'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Xu, Yanwen'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Zhang, Xiaolong'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Haran, Kiruba Sivasubramaniam'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Senesky, Debbie'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wang, Pingfeng'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0951832023006282'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832023006282'}]",,application/json,,S0951-8320(23)00628-2,Elsevier Ltd.,Optimal sensor placement for permanent magnet synchronous motor condition monitoring using a digital twin-assisted fault diagnosis approach,© 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

From the perspective of the life cycle of network vulnerabilities, mining and repairing vulnerabilities are analyzed by applying evolutionary game theory. The evolution process of knowledge sharing among white hats under various conditions is simulated, and a game model of the vulnerability patch cooperative development strategy among manufacturers is constructed. On this basis, the differential evolution is introduced into the update mechanism of the Wolf Colony Algorithm (WCA) to produce better replacement individuals with greater probability from the perspective of both attack and defense. Through the simulation experiment, it is found that the convergence speed of the probability (X) of white Hat 1 choosing the knowledge sharing policy is related to the probability (x 0) of white Hat 2 choosing the knowledge sharing policy initially, and the probability (y 0) of white hat 2 choosing the knowledge sharing policy initially. When y 0 = 0.9, X converges rapidly in a relatively short time. When y 0 is constant and x 0 is small, the probability curve of the “cooperative development” strategy converges to 0. It is concluded that the higher the trust among the white hat members in the temporary team, the stronger their willingness to share knowledge, which is conducive to the mining of loopholes in the system. The greater the probability of a hacker attacking the vulnerability before it is fully disclosed, the lower the willingness of manufacturers to choose the ""cooperative development"" of vulnerability patches. Applying the improved wolf colony-co-evolution algorithm can obtain the equilibrium solution of the ""attack and defense game model"", and allocate the security protection resources according to the importance of nodes.

This piecemeal implementation of DTs often leaves practitioners wondering what roles (or functions) to allocate to DTs in a work system, and how might it impact humans. A lack of knowledge about the roles that humans and DTs play in a work system can result in significant costs, misallocation of resources, unrealistic expectations from DTs, and strategic misalignments. To alleviate this challenge, this paper answers the research question: When humans work with DTs, what types of roles can a DT play, and to what extent can those roles be automated? Specifically, we propose a two-dimensional conceptual framework, Levels of Digital Twin (LoDT). The framework is an integration of the types of roles a DT can play, broadly categorized under (1) Observer, (2) Analyst, (3) Decision Maker, and (4) Action Executor, and the extent of automation for each of these roles, divided into five different levels ranging from completely manual to fully automated.

We also present design recommendations for developing next-generation MES/MOM as a strong core to make factories smart and responsive. First, we analyze the architectural design challenges of MES/MOM in IIoT through a selective literature review. We then present an exploratory case study in which we implement our homegrown MES/MOM data model design based on ISA 95 in Aalborg University's Smart Production Lab, which is a reconfigurable cyber-physical production system. This was achieved through the use of a custom module for the open-source Odoo ERP platform (mainly version 14). Finally, we enrich our case study with three industrial design demonstrators and combine the findings with a quality function deployment (QFD) method to determine design requirements for next-generation IIoT-connected MES/MOM.

The model and testing environment is evolved from model, hardware to vehicle in the loop and proving ground testing stages, similar to standard development cycle in the automotive industry.

Digital twin is a key technology for the continued development of nuclear energy applications. The digital twin requires real-time, high-precision simulations that are beyond the capabilities of current nuclear energy system simulation programs. Therefore, this study proposes an autonomous calibration method for the digital twin of nuclear power plants to compensate for the error in the results of the low accuracy digital twin that can run quickly to obtain higher accuracy results to meet both high accuracy and real-time requirements. The proposed method consists of offline and online stages. In the offline stage, digital twin simulations are first performed. The simulated data and corresponding measurements data (or real data) are used to build an error database, which will be used for the next step of data-driven model training. To reduce the complexity of calibration model, the error database samples are then grouped by clustering. Data-driven calibration models are built on each group based on the simulated data and errors. In the online stage, the digital twin runs in parallel with the nuclear power plant and receives real-time data. The calibration model is continuously updated using dynamic error database. The feasibility of the new proposed method has been demonstrated on measured data from the PKLIII B3.1 steam generator pipe rupture (SGTR) experiment.

The emergence of CPS, digital twin, cloud computing, big data and other new technologies based on the industrial Internet enables information acquisition and pure reactive scheduling more practical to some extent. However, how to build a new architecture to solve the problems which traditional dynamic scheduling methods cannot solve becomes a new research challenge. Therefore, this paper designs a new bi-level distributed dynamic workshop scheduling architecture, which is based on the workshop digital twin scheduling agent and multiple service unit digital twin scheduling agents. Within this architecture, scheduling a physical workshop is decomposed to the whole workshop scheduling in the first level and its service unit scheduling in the second level. On the first level, the whole workshop scheduling is executed by its virtual workshop coordination (scheduling) agent embedded with the workshop digital twin consisting of multi-service unit digital twins. On the second level, each service unit scheduling coordinated by the first level scheduling is executed in a distributed way by the corresponding service unit scheduling agent associated with its service unit digital twin. The benefits of the new architecture include (1) if a dynamic scheduling only requires a single service unit scheduling, it will then be performed in the corresponding service unit scheduling without involving other service units, which will make the scheduling locally, simply and robustly. (2) when a dynamic scheduling requires changes in multiple service units in a coordinated way, the first level scheduling will be executed and then coordinate the second level service unit scheduling accordingly.

They are described by a subset of the respective digital product twins, with a specific focus on product integration.

The fluctuating nature of renewable energy is considered, and microgrid energy management is investigated using probabilistic and deterministic assumptions. To enhance energy management, digital twin simulations are employed, providing a virtual representation of the power grid. This enables accurate analysis and prediction of system behavior in different scenarios. Digital twins help simulate the effects of load profiles on microgrids, facilitating better energy planning and decision-making. The proposed framework considers objective functions related to cost reduction, voltage profile improvement, and voltage stability enhancement. The whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is applied to solve the complex and nonlinear energy management problem, aiming to minimize costs and enhance voltage stability. Simulation results show that an optimally installed PV system and wind turbines reduce energy costs and improve overall system efficiency in smart cities.

In manufacturing, industrial robots can be trained to learn dexterous manipulation skills from raw pixels with DRL. However, training robots in the real world is a time-consuming, high-cost and of safety concerns process. A frequently adopted approach for easing this is to train robots through simulations first and then deploy algorithms (or policies) on physical robots. How to transfer policies of robot learning from simulation to the real world is a challenging issue. Digital twin that is able to create a dynamic, up-to-date representation of a physical robotic grasping system provides an effective approach for addressing this issue. In this paper, we focus on the scenario of DRL-based assembly-oriented industrial grasping and propose a digital twin-enabled approach for achieving effective transfer of DRL algorithms to a physical robot.

In the design phase, virtual simulation and virtual reality technology are integrated to construct virtual twins of various HRC scenarios for testing and analyzing potential safety hazards. In the production phase, the safety distance between humans and robots of the HRC scene is monitored and calculated by an iterative algorithm according to machine vision and a convolutional neural network.

In this study, we develop and solve an integrated problem of procurement, production, and distribution strategies (PPDs) in a medium-scale food processing company. Using the digital twin approach, the model considers the industrial symbiosis opportunities between the supplier, manufacturer, and customer using interval and sequence variables operating in a constrained environment using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and agent-based simulation (ABS) methodology. The study optimizes the make-span and lead time, simultaneously achieving a higher level of digitalization. The analysis demonstrates how digital twin accelerates supply chain productivity by improving makespan time, data redundancy (DR), optimal scheduling plan (OSP), overall operations effectiveness (OOE), overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), and capacity utilization. Our findings provide compelling evidence that the seamless integration PPDs enormously enhance production flexibility, resulting in an excellent service level of 94 %. Managers leverage real-time simulation to accurately estimate the replenishment point with minimal lead time, ensuring optimized operations. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that implementing PPDs has yielded considerable benefits.

The instance of digital twin in references mostly concentrates a particular application, while it is still a lack of a method for constructing the complex digital twin in the total elements, the variable scale of working environments, changeable process, not even the coupling effects. In this paper, a novel modeling method for such a complex digital twin is proposed based on the standardized processing on the model division and assembly. Firstly, the complex model of digital twin is divided into several simple models according to the composition, context, component, and code in 4C architecture. Composition and context make the digital twin focus on the effective elements in a specific scale and scenario. Component and code develop the digital twin in standard-based modularization. Secondly, assemble the simple models of digital twins into the complex model through information fusion, multi-scale association and multi-scenarios iterations. Ontology establishes the complete information library of the entities on different digital twins. Knowledge graph bridges the structure relationship between the different scales of digital twins. The scenario iterations realize the behavior interaction and the accuracy calculation results.

This paper proposes a blockchain-based Proof of Authority (PoA) trust mechanism to provide high-quality services such as security and data privacy in IIoT. Furthermore, to enhance the authority of decentralized digital twin combined blockchain networks, we introduce a Deterministic Pseudo-Random Generation (DPRG) to generate a genesis block. To evaluate the trustworthiness of the proposed system, we simulate the blockchain network with a digital twin using IIoT sensor nodes. The simulation result shows that the PoA-based authority master nodes can reduce energy consumption and enhance data security.",false,2023-04-30,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167739X22003636,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'A., Sasikumar'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Vairavasundaram, Subramaniyaswamy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Kotecha, Ketan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'V., Indragandhi'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Ravi, Logesh'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Selvachandran, Ganeshsree'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Abraham, Ajith'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167739X22003636'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X22003636'}]",,application/json,,S0167-739X(22)00363-6,Elsevier B.V.,Blockchain-based trust mechanism for digital twin empowered Industrial Internet of Things,© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Almost all production processes are multistage in nature, and so most digital twins involve multiple physical phenomena, process steps and different solvers for the simulations. Good interoperability between model solvers and processes are key to achieving a functional digital twin. Passing information between steps can be challenging, complex and time consuming, especially for material data, because the constitutive model interacts with the full modeling environment: material behavior is interdependent with the history of the process, the solver subroutines and the boundary conditions. This work proposes a flexible yet robust standardization approach, called FlexMM, for dealing with material data, constitutive models, measurement data or mathematical models to overcome part of the abovementioned complexity. The implementation of FlexMM consists of a general rule structure in which constitutive behavior is described, as well as its interaction with the subroutines used by the finite element solver. The definition of the constitutive model is stored in a separate file, in which the material behavior can be described in a user selected format, such as look-up tables, standard statistical models, machine learning or analytical expressions. After a calculation step, the new local material properties are mapped to a file to facilitate the next history-dependent step. In this way, the interaction between the different fabrication steps and processes can be incorporated. A material/process case study is presented to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of FlexMM.",false,2020-10-31,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0965997820300855,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Groen, Manso'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Solhjoo, Soheil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Voncken, Ruud'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Post, Jan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Vakis, Antonis.

The technology offers a possibility to increase the total energy production of floating wind farms by minimizing the wake effect. We assume each of the individual wind turbine is completed with a propulsion system and is allowed to reposition itself anywhere in the restricted domain. The simulations are performed in a digital twin platform based on Unity 3D, where wind speed and direction are used as inputs for the digital twin. Furthermore, Jensen’s wake model is implemented to model the dynamic behaviour of the wind. To find an optimal position for all individual wind turbines, two methods are proposed. The first method is based on reactive control, while the second method is based on optimal control.

Traditional energy sources such as coal, oil, and gas have contributed to global pollution and have adverse effects on human health. As a result, the use of renewable energy for power generation has increased tremendously. One such area of research is solar irradiation prediction, which utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. With the use of real-time predicted data, the digital twins are intended to add value to the organization by identifying and preventing problems, predicting performance, and improving operations. This paper provides an overview of various learning methods used for predicting irradiance and presents a new ensemble solar irradiance forecasting model that combines eight machine learning models to ensure model diversity. The model's most critical factors for predicting irradiance include temperature, cloudiness index, relative humidity, and day of the week. To conduct a comprehensive analysis, the proposed 8-Stacking Regression Cross Validation (8 STR-CV) model was tested using data from three different climatic zones in India.

However, as LIBs undergo repeated charging and discharging cycles, they experience performance degradation. When the rated capacity of LIBs drops to approximately 80 %, retirement becomes necessary. Therefore, accurately determining real-time battery degradation is of paramount importance. This study presents a digital twin framework for analyzing and predicting LIB degradation performance. Within this framework, the back propagation neural network (BPNN) is employed to predict and complete the partial discharge voltage curve of the actual battery cycle. Building upon this, in conjunction with the battery's state of charge (SOC), the convolutional neural networks-long short term memory-attention (CNN-LSTM-Attention) model is utilized to real-time forecast the maximum available capacity of LIBs and reveal the battery's degradation state. Experimental results demonstrate a 99.6 % accuracy in completing the partial discharge voltage. Moreover, the prediction accuracy for maximum available capacity surpasses 99 % with a maximum error of less than 3 mAh.

Since the rate of degradation depends on external stress factors such as the state-of-charge, charge/discharge-rate, and depth of cycle, it can be directly influenced through the operation strategy. In this contribution, we propose a model predictive control (MPC) framework for designing aging aware operation strategies. By simulating the entire BESS lifetime on a digital twin, different aging aware optimization models can be benchmarked and the optimal value for aging cost can be determined. In a case study, the application of generating profit through arbitrage trading on the EPEX SPOT intraday electricity market is investigated. For that, a linearized model for the calendar and cyclic capacity loss of a lithium iron phosphate cell is presented. The results show that using the MPC framework to determine the optimal aging cost can significantly increase the lifetime profitability of a BESS, compared to the prevalent approach of selecting aging cost based on the cost of the battery system. Furthermore, the lifetime profit from energy arbitrage can be increased by an additional 24.9% when using the linearized calendar degradation model and by 29.3% when using both the linearized calendar and cyclic degradation model, compared to an energy throughput based aging cost model. By examining price data from 2019 to 2022, the case study demonstrates that the recent increases in prices and price fluctuations on wholesale electricity markets have led to a substantial increase of the achievable lifetime profit.",false,2023-10-15,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306261923008954,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Collath, Nils'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Cornejo, Martin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Engwerth, Veronika'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Hesse, Holger'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Jossen, Andreas'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306261923008954'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261923008954'}]",,application/json,Full,S0306-2619(23)00895-4,The Authors.

The digital twin keeps up-to-date information about the current state of the physical production system and it is combined with the production planner utilizing artificial intelligence methods. Production recipes and concrete process instantiations are planned for each production order on-the-fly, based on the production system state retrieved form the digital twin.

The authors argue the way Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are conceived as singularly focused “point solutions” undermine future opportunities. An evolutionary view is overlooked because extant literature describes technology in a particular epoch. An ecosystem perspective needs to influence IT strategy as an emerging “digital layer” transcends a smart city and continues to function long after a traditional construction project completes. We describe innovation as a succession of transformational waves in an evolutionary process that is currently manifesting as “Industry 4.0” and changing expectations for the construction industry. The paper concludes by listing emerging trends and warns existing UK construction companies must understand the transformational process they are in and learn how to adapt with a stronger drive for R&D.,false,2018-09-30,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926580517309512,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Woodhead, Roy'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Stephenson, Paul'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Morrey, Denise'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926580517309512'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580517309512'}]",,application/json,,S0926-5805(17)30951-2,Published by Elsevier B.V.,Digital construction: From point solutions to IoT ecosystem,Crown Copyright © 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AM has enabled advantages of reduced material usage, geometric freedom, and production automation, shaping the future of the manufacturing industries. With the rapid expansion of AM applications, feedstock materials have developed noticeably, from polymers and ceramics to metals and composites. The progress in metal feedstock material discoveries has empowered the exploration of implementing new AM technologies. Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) is one of the most common and cost-effective material extrusion AM technologies. This study explores the effect of the infill pattern on the tensile mechanical properties of metal parts produced via FFF, using two feedstock materials, 17-PH stainless steel and copper. Two approaches are designed to investigate the results: experimental tensile test, and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with digital twin reconstruction method. Results show that 17-4 PH Stainless Steel samples with a triangular infill exhibited a 42% drop in ultimate tensile strength compared to solid infill. However, it also revealed a 34% reduction in mass, cost saving of 36%, and a faster fabrication with a 25% reduction in lead time. At the same time, copper samples with triangular infill exhibited a 22% drop in ultimate tensile strength and a 12% mass reduction. However, it revealed a similar lead time with only a 3% reduction.

The combination of process modelling and computer simulation provides clear understanding to know about the improvement potential of the plant. This paper introduces the real time optimization, and its online implementation in series of fixed-bed catalytic reactors process. In general, catalyst deactivation occurs in most of the fixed bed reactors, and optimal operation of reactor systems undergoing catalyst deactivation is an important economic issue. In the process of controlling the chemical reaction, it is necessary to change the operating conditions according to the catalyst activity. A system is developed to deal with the depreciating catalyst activity by using the concept of mathematical optimization methods that allow to calculate the optimal operating conditions of multiple variables simultaneously. The system consists of 3 modules, (i) Analyser: This module consists of steady state one-dimensional plug flow reactor model, which automatically receives the plant historian data as well as lab analysis data such as flow rate, temperature, concentration etc. to estimate the catalyst activity. (ii) Predictor: This module develops the empirical equation using the activity data from the analyser with the help of Recursive Least Square method. This empirical model estimates the real time catalyst activity where no process data is available. In general the catalyst activity is assumed to decrease at a constant rate with respect to the age as given by the vendor information. (iii)Optimizer: In this module the objective function and its constraints are defined. Minimization of objective function is carried out using appropriate algorithm while ensuring the product quality constraints. Online implementation is carried out by connecting this system with plant historian data and displaying the calculated optimum conditions on the dashboard.

Due to varying routes and a high variance of workpieces, material flows in cyber-physical production systems can get highly complex, which can lead to physically induced disturbances that can result in accidents or decreased throughput and high costs. This issue can be addressed by applying a physics engine to simulate the physical interaction between workpieces and the material handling systems during the operation. Connecting such a digital model to a real material handling system in order to derive simulation-based decision support leads to the concept of digital twins. To date, few practical implementations of digital twins in manufacturing outside the machine tool domain were reported. Therefore, this paper describes the modeling and the subsequent implementation of an integrated system that consists of a real material handling system and its digital twin, based on physics simulation.

It is responsible for taking the camera's views and finding the maximum number of matches between the images yielding a dense point cloud of the observed scene. Since this process is based on the matching between images it greatly depends on the ability of features matching throughout different images. To improve the matching performance several researchers have proposed the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve the MVS problem. Despite the progress in the MVS problem with the usage of CNNs, the Video RAM (VRAM) consumption within these approaches is usually far greater than classical methods, that rely more on RAM, which is cheaper to expand than VRAM. This work then follows the progress made in CasMVSNet in the reduction of GPU memory usage, and further study the changes in the feature extraction process. The Average Group-wise Correlation is used in the cost volume generation, to reduce the number of channels in the cost volume, yielding a reduction in GPU memory usage without noticeable penalties in the result.

The first major challenge is to (re-)define what the manufacturing of the future will be, if we wish to: ① raise public awareness of new manufacturing’s economic and societal impacts, and ② garner the unequivocal support of policy-makers. The second major challenge is to recognize that manufacturing in the future will consist of systems of hybrid systems of human and robotic operators; additive and subtractive processes; metal and composite materials; and cyber and physical systems. Therefore, studying the interfaces between constituencies and standards becomes important and essential. The third challenge is to develop a common framework in which the technology, manufacturing business case, and ecosystem readiness can be evaluated concurrently in order to shorten the time it takes for products to reach customers.

Many enablers have been identified across various studies; however, a comprehensive synthesis defining the enablers of design for digital fabrication does not yet exist. This work conducts a systematic literature review of 59 journal articles published in the past decade and identifies 140 enablers under eight categories: actors, resources, conditions, attributes, processes, artefacts, values and risks. The enablers’ frequency network is illustrated using an adjacency matrix. Through the lens of actor-network theory, the work creates a relational ontology to demonstrate the linkages between different enablers. Three examples are presented using onion diagrams: circular construction focus, business model focus and digital twin in industrialisation focus.

In this study, we demonstrated that the keyhole pores formation in the laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing process can be significantly reduced by the constant laser power density scan strategy. The constant laser power density is implemented on a custom-built testbed by continuously varying the laser power with the laser scan speed through the time-stepped digital commands developed. Two cubic nickel alloy 625 parts of identical geometry were built, one with the constant laser power density scan strategy, and another with the conventional constant laser power scan strategy. The X-ray computed tomography (XCT) measurement shows a 67% porosity reduction in the part built with constant laser power density. However, the mechanisms for defect formation are not easily distinguishable in XCT, which gives a ‘total’ count of pores. To further investigate the effect of scan strategies on pore formation, two digital twins of process monitoring (DTPM), meltpool intensity volume (MPIV) and melt pool area volume (MAV), were created. The DTPM not only helps to distinguish the keyhole pores from the lack of fusion defects but also provides a foundation for the future development of machine learning models.",false,2022-12-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890695522001080,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Yeung, H.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Kim, F.H.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Donmez, M.A.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Neira, J.'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0890695522001080'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890695522001080'}]",,application/json,,S0890-6955(22)00108-0,,Keyhole pores reduction in laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing of nickel alloy 625,Published by Elsevier Ltd.,0,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Keyhole pores'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Scan strategies'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'X-ray computed tomography'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Digital twins'}]",false,International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture,,103957,,fla,December 2022,10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2022.103957,103957,doi:10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2022.103957,,08906955,183,,,,103957,

This paper proposes a health assessment based on 3D reconstruction technology for railway track maintenance using a mobile robotic sensing platform. By combining multiple sensing and taking advantage of a robotic manipulator, a digital model of the target track components is built by a robot-actuated vision system which provides better 3D structural and surface condition reconstruction. Global geo-location and surrounding laser scanning are integrated to reinforce the digital completeness of the model for intelligent management. The new method consists of the following steps: First, according to scheduled maintenance tasks, a Robotics Inspection and Repair System (RIRS) navigates to the task location and uses the onboard depth camera for positioning. Then robot-mounted vision system is guided with an automated trajectory to build the 3D reconstruction of the track or repair object using the vision modeling technique. Finally, the 3D reconstructed model is fused with surrounding mapping of depth vision and Lidar scanning. Both laboratory tests and a realistic track test validated the feasibility of the proposed method by creating an accurate 3D reconstructed model. The modeled rail steel section size is quantitively compared with the ground truth in dimension, demonstrating good accuracy with a size error of less than 0.3 cm. The main contribution includes: (1) unmanned automatic 3D reconstruction by a robotic mobile manipulator, (2) the technique trims the reconstruction details & data to the specific maintenance goal or components, which supports the infrastructure maintenance towards the high-detailed & target-oriented digital management. This combination strategy of robotic automation and sensor fusion lies down a promising foundation for automated digital twin establishment for railway maintenance with autonomous RIRS, and upgrades technology readiness and digital intelligence for maintenance management",false,2023-06-30,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166361523000507,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Rahman, Miftahur'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Liu, Haochen'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Masri, Mohammed'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Durazo-Cardenas, Isidro'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Starr, Andrew'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166361523000507'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361523000507'}]",,application/json,Full,S0166-3615(23)00050-7,Cranfield University.

GIDPC’s cooling capacity, coefficient of performance (COP), dew point efficiency, wet-bulb efficiency, supply air temperature and surface area of the layers are selected as outputs. The optimum values of aforementioned operating and design parameters are identified by the MOEO to maximise the cooling capacity, COP, wet-bulb efficiencies and to minimise the surface area of the layers in four identified climates within Köppen-Geiger climate classification, namely: tropical rainforest, arid, Mediterranean hot summer and hot summer continental climates. The system monthly and annual performances in the identified optimum conditions are compared with the base system and the results show the annual improvements of up to 72.75% in COP and 23.57% in surface area.

Depending on varying product specifications, the production process may differ within the performed manufacturing steps and within the definition of process ”normality”, which refers to the multi-dimensional sensor data captured during the manufacturing process. Process Mining offers excellent process discovery and monitoring capabilities; however, it relies on well-defined event logs. In Industry 4.0 manufacturing, this requirement poses a significant challenge as data commonly generates by a range of low-level sensor measurements, i.e. process-state data such as temperature or humidity and product-state data such as quality measurements or material compositions. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of Process Mining methodologies in combination with concepts of data-driven Digital Twins to discover and monitor process control-flow. We introduce a concept called self-discovering and event-log-aware Digital control-flow Twins to bridge the gap of Process Mining, Digital Twins and continuous process data. We overcome the abstraction gap by generating discrete event logs backed by descriptive statistics of reoccurring process-state characteristics using unsupervised clustering.

One of the major challenges in realizing continuous biological manufacturing lies in implementing continuous chromatography. Given the complex operation mode and various operation parameters, it is challenging to develop a continuous process. Due to the process parameters being mainly determined by the breakthrough curves and elution behaviors, chromatographic modeling has gradually been used to assist in process development and characterization. Model-assisted approaches could realize multi-parameter interaction investigation and multi-objective optimization by integrating continuous process models. These approaches could reduce time and resource consumption while achieving a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the process. This paper reviews the application of modeling tools in continuous chromatography process development, characterization and design. Model-assisted process development approaches for continuous capture and polishing steps are introduced and summarized.

A control stage is a key component for pressure and flow control in steam turbines of power plants. Its modelling and simulation for digital twins are important measures for steam turbine operation diagnosis and optimization. However, sequential operation modes of valves in a control stage result in dramatic changes in thermal and mechanical behaviours of the control stage, and modelling the change in behaviours still remains a challenge due to lack of measurements. In this paper, a hybrid modelling method based on the first-principle mechanism and actual operation data is proposed. Inlet flow of a control stage are obtained by calculating flow coefficient at the full range of sequential operation of valves. Then, characteristic functions of a control stage are obtained using the first-principle mechanism. In order to verify the reliability of the proposed method, a control stage of an ultra-supercritical steam turbine with typical sequential valves operation mode is modelled and simulated. Results show that the average value of the simulation relative error is less than 1%, which proves that the method has high simulation accuracy and reliability and lays a foundation for application of digital twins in smart power plants.",false,2020-12-31,,Book Series,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128233771500203,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Yu, Jianxi'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Liu, Pei'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Li, Zheng'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128233771500203'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128233771500203'}]",9780128233771,application/json,,B978-0-12-823377-1.50020-3,Elsevier B.V.,A Hybrid Modelling Approach to Developing Digital Twins of an Ultra-supercritical Steam Turbine Control Stage,Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Collaboration between human and the autonomy becomes imperative factor for improving productivity. However, current human-machine interfaces (HMI) such as 2D screens or panels require human knowledge of process and long-term experience to operate, which is not intuitive for beginning workers or is designed to work with the autonomy. This study proposes a human interface framework of cyber-physical system (CPS) based on virtual reality, named as immersive and interactive CPS (I2CPS), to create an interface for human-machine-autonomy collaboration. By combination of data-to-information protocol and middleware, MTConnect and Robot Operating System (ROS), heterogeneous physical systems were integrated with virtual assets such as digital models, digital shadows, and virtual traces of human works in the virtual reality (VR) based interface. All the physical and virtual assets were integrated in the interface that human, autonomy, and physical system can collaborate. Applying constraints in the VR interface and deploying virtual human works to industrial robots were demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the I2CPS framework, showing collaboration between human and autonomy: augmentation of human skills by autonomy and virtual robot teaching to generate automatic robot programs.",false,2022-01-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S027861252100248X,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Yun, Huitaek'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Jun, Martin B.G.'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S027861252100248X'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027861252100248X'}]",,application/json,,S0278-6125(21)00248-X,The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

Recently, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach has shown potential for addressing such adaptive task allocation. It remains unanswered, however, whether or not DRL can address adaptive task allocation problems in dynamic robotic construction environments. In this paper, we developed and tested a digital twin-driven DRL learning method to explore the potential of DRL for adaptive task allocation in robotic construction environments. Specifically, the digital twin synthesizes sensory data from physical assets and is used to simulate a variety of dynamic robotic construction site conditions within which a DRL agent can interact. As a result, the agent can learn an adaptive task allocation strategy that increases project performance. We tested this method with a case project in which a virtual robotic construction project (i.e., interlocking concrete bricks are delivered and assembled by robots) was digitally twinned for DRL training and testing. Results indicated that the DRL model’s task allocation approach reduced construction time by 36% in three dynamic testing environments when compared to a rule-based imperative model. The proposed DRL learning method promises to be an effective tool for adaptive task allocation in dynamic robotic construction environments. Such an adaptive task allocation method can help construction robots cope with uncertainties and can ultimately improve construction project performance by efficiently prioritizing assigned tasks.",false,2022-08-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1474034622001689,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Lee, Dongmin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Lee, SangHyun'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Masoud, Neda'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Krishnan, M.S.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Li, Victor C.'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1474034622001689'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474034622001689'}]",,application/json,,S1474-0346(22)00168-9,Elsevier Ltd.,Digital twin-driven deep reinforcement learning for adaptive task allocation in robotic construction,© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

First presented are the secondary injury cascade set in motion by the primary lesion and highlights in therapeutic development for mitigating the acute pathophysiologic process. Then summarized are current pharmacological strategies for modulation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission to enhance recovery in bench and clinical studies of subacute and chronic SCI. Last examined is how neuromechanical devices (i.e., electrical stimulation, robotic assistance, brain-computer interface, and augmented sensory feedback) could be comprehensively engineered to engage efferent and afferent motosensory pathways to induce neuroplasticity-based neural pattern generation. Emerging evidence shows that computational models of the human neuromusculoskeletal system (i.e., human digital twins) can serve as functionalized anchors to integrate different neuromechanical and pharmacological interventions into a single multimodal prothesis. The system, if appropriately built, may cybernetically optimize treatment outcomes via coordination of heterogeneous biosensory, system output, and control signals. Overall, these rehabilitation protocols involved neuromodulation to evoke beneficial adaptive changes within spared supraspinal, intracord, and peripheral neuromuscular circuits to elicit neurological improvement. Therefore, qualitatively advancing the theoretical understanding of spinal cord neurobiology and neuromechanics is pivotal to designing new ways to reinstate locomotion after SCI. Future research efforts should concentrate on personalizing combination therapies consisting of pharmacological adjuncts, targeted neurobiological and neuromuscular repairs, and brain-computer interfaces, which follow multimodal neuromechanical principles.",false,2021-05-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014488621000170,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Pizzolato, Claudio'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Gunduz, Mehmet A.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Palipana, Dinesh'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wu, Jingnan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Grant, Gary'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Hall, Susan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Dennison, Rachel'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Zafonte, Ross D.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Lloyd, David G.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Teng, Yang D.'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014488621000170'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014488621000170'}]",,application/json,,S0014-4886(21)00017-0,Elsevier Inc.,Non-invasive approaches to functional recovery after spinal cord injury: Therapeutic targets and multimodal device interventions,© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Further, we critically analyzed current strategies to couple cell models with computational fluid dynamics to study the performance of industrial microorganisms in large-scale bioprocesses, which is of crucial importance for the bio-based production industries. One of the most challenging aspects in this context is gathering intracellular data under industrially relevant conditions.

The study aims to reveal the synthesis between AI and GB, as well as to highlight research trends along with knowledge gaps that may be tackled in future AI-in-GB research. A quantitative bibliometric analysis was conducted to objectively identify the major research hotspots, trends, knowledge gaps and future research needs based on 383 research publications identified from Scopus. A further qualitative systematic analysis was also conducted on 76 screened research publications on AI-in-GB. Through this mixed-methods systematic review, knowledge gaps were identified, and future research directions of AI-in-GB were proposed as follows: digital twins and AI of things; blockchain; robotics and 4D printing; and legal, ethical, and moral responsibilities of AI-in-GB. This study adds to the GB knowledge domain by synthesizing the state-of-the-art of AI-in-GB and revealing the research needs in this field to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the AEC sector.",false,2022-05-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926580522000656,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Debrah, Caleb'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Chan, Albert P.C.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Darko, Amos'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926580522000656'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580522000656'}]",,application/json,,S0926-5805(22)00065-6,Elsevier B.V.,Artificial intelligence in green building,© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

This article focuses on a thorough review of a digital twin of a centrifugal pump for performance evaluation. An exception to conventional performance evaluation method of a centrifugal pump can be made by its digital twin. This also proves beneficial for higher capacity pumps with appropriate scaling of the twin as the variant changes. A digital twin system may be useful to eliminate the setup and installation time, and the capital cost to develop product specific test bench. A twin which can be simulated and evaluated using MATLAB can be developed. The process that was used for creating a digital twin of centrifugal pump involves steps like selection of parameters to be measured, selection of microcontroller for data acquisition, IOT cloud interfacing using ThingSpeak, simulation of MATLAB model of centrifugal pump in ideal environment for flow rate measurement using Simscape. For obtaining the real-time data for flow rate of the centrifugal pump, a water flow sensor was attached to the pump and the sensor data was obtained and uploaded to ThingSpeak using ESP32 WiFi module. The ideal data for the flow rate of the centrifugal pump was obtained by creating a SimScape model of the centrifugal pump and flow sensor arrangement and simulating it in ideal environment. This will include, receiving sensor data to and during the operation of the pump and monitored on ThingSpeak IOT platform. The result of this entire process will be a statistical twin of a centrifugal pump for its performance evaluation based on the performance parameter- flow rate.",false,2023-12-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221478532206415X,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Kasat, Pratik'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Kulkarni, Mrunal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Gundeti, Karthik'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Kangale, Kunal'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Deshmukh, B.B.'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Mistry, R.D.'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221478532206415X'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221478532206415X'}]",,application/json,,S2214-7853(22)06415-X,Elsevier Ltd.,Developing a digital twin of centrifugal pump for performance evaluation,Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

As a potential solution, digital twins are expected to promote this development by integrating them with dynamic information. This article analyses current research on remanufacturing supply chains and digital twins, and discusses the potential usefulness, challenges and solutions of using digital twins in remanufacturing supply chains. We conduct a systematic literature review to answer two research questions: 1) whether the information asymmetry in the current remanufacturing supply chain has been resolved; and 2) whether digital twins have a positive impact in solving problems with information asymmetries in remanufacturing supply chains. By analysing 288 articles, we find that, first, this problem remains to be solved, there being two research gaps in particular. Secondly, we find that the digital-twin applications are conducive to solving this problem. In addition, this article discusses the potential challenges to this application and proposes four future research directions.

Digital twins of machine tools and machining processes combine advanced digital techniques and production domain knowledge, facilitate the enhancement of agility, traceability, and resilience of production systems, and help machine tool builders achieve a paradigm shift from one-time products provision to on-going service delivery. However, the adaptability and accuracy of digital twins at the shopfloor level are restricted by heterogeneous data sources, modeling precision as well as uncertainties from dynamical industrial environments. This article proposes a novel modeling framework to address these inadequacies by in-depth integrating AI techniques and machine tool expertise using aggregated data along the product development process. A data processing procedure is constructed to contextualize metadata sources from the design, planning, manufacturing, and quality stages and link them into a digital thread. On this consistent data basis, a modeling pipeline is presented to incorporate production and machine tool prior knowledge into AI development pipeline, while considering the multi-fidelity nature of data sources in dynamic industrial circumstances. In terms of implementation, we first introduce our existing work for building digital twins of machine tool and manufacturing process. Within this infrastructure, we developed a hybrid learning-based digital twin for manufacturing process following proposed modeling framework and tested it in an external industrial project exemplarily for real-time workpiece quality monitoring. The result indicates that the proposed hybrid learning-based digital twin enables learning uncertainties of the interaction of machine tools and machining processes in real industrial environments, thus allows estimating and enhancing the modeling reliability, depending on the data quality and accessibility.

An accurate digital twin of roaster furnace can help to explore the influence of control parameters and serve as a test platform to verify the effectiveness of control strategies. However, the traditional thermodynamics cannot be used for dynamic modeling, and inability to measure key data greatly affects the accuracy of kinetic modeling. Therefore, this paper establishes a novel digital twin of zinc roaster furnace based on knowledge-guided variable-mass thermodynamics. First, based on the integration of mechanism analysis for mass balance and energy balance, a dynamic modeling method is proposed. Then, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is introduced to optimize the parameters of conversion rates guided by knowledge. Finally, by connecting the dynamic model with distributed control system (DCS) through OPC communication protocol, a digital twin of roaster furnace is constructed. Extensive experiments show that the simulation results of the digital twin roughly agree with the actual industrial data under steady and dynamic working conditions, and the application of the digital twin on the performance analysis of control parameters and testing of control strategies can provide guidance for the optimal control of roaster furnace.",false,2023-05-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957582023001933,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wang, Chengzhu'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wang, Zhijie'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Huang, Keke'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Li, Yonggang'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Yang, Chunhua'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957582023001933'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582023001933'}]",,application/json,,S0957-5820(23)00193-3,Institution of Chemical Engineers.

The lack of timely and effective control of traditional HVAC is insufficient to control IAQ for the preservation of historical buildings. This research proposed a novel Multiple Output Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) - Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) integration method and combined it with the automatic control using digital twin technology to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of multiple IAQ management for the preservation of whole indoor spaces. This method considered visual impacts and minimized the external equipment impact. The sequencing order of multiple IAQ enhancements by adjusting HVAC control was investigated based on the priority of multiple IAQ parameters on historic building preservation. The proposed Multiple Output GRU prediction reduced the time by at least 1/3 for training and validation. As heritage buildings restrict the installation of sensors, CFD was used to identify the maximum value and location based on sensed IAQ data for adjustment triggers.

With access to data from multiple sources, manufacturers can provide on-demand and customised products. However, existing research of smart customisation has focused on data generated from the physical world, not virtual models. As physical data is constrained by what has already occurred, it is limited in the identification of new areas to improve customer satisfaction. A new technology called digital twin aims to achieve this integration of physical and virtual entities. Incorporation of digital twin into the paradigm of existing data-driven smart customisation will make the process more responsive, adaptable and predictive.

Digital twin is expected to accurately estimate the real-time hydraulic parameters of blind spots of the pumping station system even under some adverse conditions including the interference of observation noise and model parameters drift. To solve these challenges, a digital twin framework integrating the model-driven method, control theory and data-driven method is presented. In this framework, an unsteady flow state estimation method combining frequency domain analysis and generalized predictive control theory is developed for the first time, which is superior to traditional time-domain numerical discrete methods in terms of computational efficiency and anti-noise interference. In the model parameter calibration process, the novelty concerns modeling of the optimization problem considering the dynamic operation control of the station and unsteady flow of pipelines. And this process is accomplished through the comprehensive application of the model-free adaptive control algorithm, the transient flow model and the particle swarm optimization algorithm. This work is applied to a pumping station in a product pipeline to verify its effectiveness in estimating the transient flow state of data blind spots and map the dynamic operation behavior under the interference of colored noise and parameter drift.",false,2022-07-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057821004493,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'He, Lei'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wen, Kai'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Gong, Jing'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wu, Changchun'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019057821004493'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019057821004493'}]",,application/json,,S0019-0578(21)00449-3,ISA.

The conventional physical model building relies entirely on experts and takes much time and effort. This arduousness has hampered the widespread use of digital twins. To overcome the difficulty and enable non-experts to build a practical physical model, we aim to develop an automated physical model builder, AutoPMoB. AutoPMoB conducts five tasks: 1) searching literature databases for documents relating to a target process, 2) converting the format of each document to HTML format, 3) extracting information required to build a physical model, 4) judging whether the extracted information is equivalent in different documents to unify the expressions, and 5) reorganizing the information to output a desired physical model. In the present study, we proposed an architecture of AutoPMoB and developed its prototype. By building a physical model of a continuous stirred-tank reactor, we have demonstrated that the prototype can automatically build a model that meets all requirements.

In this chapter, the current state of the art of various advanced technologies used to reduce food grain losses during drying, milling, sorting, packaging, and storage is discussed. A future outlook to further develop these advances to drastically reduce the postharvest losses of food grains is also elucidated.

Industry 5.0 offers a powerful framework for understanding the role of technologies in enhancing ESG disclosure. This conceptual paper explains ESG from the lens of management theories and views, including stakeholder theory, legitimacy theory, transaction cost economics theory, institutional theory, signaling theory, network economics theory, and the decoupling view. It then explores the application of I5.0 in enhancing ESG disclosure. The underlying values of I5.0 align with those of ESG, and I5.0 can support ESG functionalities. I5.0 is particularly useful in enhancing ESG disclosure authenticity, extending ESG disclosure from retrospective to prospective and real-time reporting, customizing ESG reports, extending the scope of reporting to multi-tier supply chains, reducing ESG cost, and enhancing the overall efficacy of ESG disclosure.

By refrigeration, they ensure that food quality is better preserved and food losses are reduced. Countries that produce fresh produce also unlock new markets for export through refrigerated container transport. Scope and approach The authors have worked in the research and development of reefer-facilitated supply chains for over two decades. Based on our research and engineering work with key stakeholders, we provide our perspective on how the industry will or should evolve. We also elaborate on upcoming trends and key bottlenecks the industry faces. This paper touches upon subjects relevant to the global fruit and vegetable trade. These topics involve (1) the fresh produce reefer market, (2) the climate inside the reefer, including temperature uniformity and controlled atmosphere trends, (3) sustainability aspects such as greenhouse gas emissions and potential energy savings, and (4) the move towards smart reefers and the use of digital food twins. Key findings We particularly encourage more research on using a controlled atmosphere to save energy and better preserve foods, the effectiveness of ethylene scrubbers in reefers, synergizing the data acquisition pipelines of different sensor systems, and integrating these data with other parts of the supply chain into one data ecosystem.

The size, complexity, and critical nature of the water and wastewater infrastructure providing such services make the planning and management of these systems extremely difficult. Following the digital revolution in many areas of our lives, the water sector has begun to benefit from digital transformation. Effective utilization of remotely sensed weather and soil moisture data for more efficient irrigation (i.e., for food production), better detection of anomalies and faults in pipe networks using artificial intelligence, the use of nature-inspired optimization to improve the management and planning of systems, and greater use of digital twins and robotics all exhibit great potential to change and improve the ways in which complex water systems are managed. However, there are additional risks associated with these developments, including—but not limited to—cybersecurity, incorrect use, and overconfidence in the capability and accuracy of digital solutions and automation. This paper identifies key advances in digital technology that have found application in the water sector, and applies forensic engineering principles to failures that have been experienced in industries further ahead with automation and digital transformation. By identifying what went wrong with new digital technologies that might have contributed to high-profile accidents in the car and aircraft industries (e.g., Tesla self-driving cars and the Boeing 737 MAX), it is possible to identify similar risks in the water sector, learn from them, and prevent future failures. The key findings show that: ① Automation will require “humans in the loop”; ② human operators must be fully aware of the technology and trained to use it; ③ fallback manual intervention should be available in case of technology malfunctioning; ④ while redundant sensors may be costly, they reduce the risks due to erroneous sensor readings; ⑤ cybersecurity risks must be considered; and ⑥ ethics issues have to be considered, given the increasing automation and interconnectedness of water systems.

Digital Twin relies on the continuously accumulated data and real-time presentation of the collected data to simultaneously update and modify with its physical counterpart. However, presenting a huge amount of collected data and information in a Digital Twin in an intuitive manner remains a challenge. Currently, augmented reality (AR) has been widely implemented in the manufacturing environment, such as product design, data management, assembly instructions, and equipment maintenance. By integrating graphics, audios and real-world objects, AR allows the users to visualise and interact with Digital Twin data at a new level. It gives the opportunity to provide intuitive and continual visualisation of the Digital Twin data. In this paper, an AR application that uses Microsoft HoloLens to visualise the Digital Twin data of a CNC milling machine in a real manufacturing environment is presented. The developed application allows the operator to monitor and control the machine tool at the same time, but also enables to interact and manage the Digital Twin data simultaneously, which provides an intuitive and consistent human machine interface to improve the efficiency during the machining process.

To achieve this goal, smart technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Twins (DT), and Internet of Things (IoT) are being increasingly utilized. However, the use of DT in agriculture is still in its early stages. This study proposes a smart irrigation framework inspired by digital twins in an application domain. The irrigation framework’s sensors and actuators are linked to their virtual counterparts to create a digital twin. The IoT platform collects, aggregates, and processes data to determine daily irrigation requirements, and the behavior of the irrigation system is simulated. The proposed framework has two main advantages: evaluating the behavior of the digital twin and IoT platform in the context of agriculture before integrating them into the field and comparing various irrigation methods with current farming methods. By providing farmers with information about soil, weather, and crops, the system has the potential to improve farm operations and reduce water consumption.",false,2024-01-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210537923001026,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Manocha, Ankush'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Sood, Sandeep Kumar'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Bhatia, Munish'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210537923001026'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210537923001026'}]",,application/json,,S2210-5379(23)00102-6,Elsevier Inc.,IoT-digital twin-inspired smart irrigation approach for optimal water utilization,© 2023 Elsevier Inc.

In literature, emerging digital technologies are considered as an enabler for the creation of additional value, the strengthening of the customer relationship, and as an accelerator of the servitization process in manufacturing. The introduction of such technologies may result in adaptations of the product & service life cycle as well as the business model. A generic product & service life cycle consisting of four phases – design, simulation, manufacturing, and usage of products and services – serves as a foundation for the integration of digital technologies and related data. It can be observed that there is a gap with respect to data integration between the manufacturing and the usage of products and services. A model-based approach including digital twinning is applied to bridge this gap and to show how data can be integrated along the product & service life cycle. The conceptual approach of such a model-based digital twin environment is presented in form of a meta model. To depict how the integration could be eased and guided in manufacturing, findings of the European project Change2Twin, where a digital twin is established for a paint production pilot, are introduced.

There are some existing challenges to achieve efficient and reliable anomaly detection of an automation system: (1) transmitting large amounts of data collected from the system to data processing components; (2) applying both historical data and real-time data for anomaly detection. This paper proposes a novel Digital Twin-driven anomaly detection framework that enables real-time health monitoring of industrial systems and anomaly prediction. Our framework, adopting the visionary edge AI or edge intelligence (EI) philosophy, provides a feasible approach to ensuring high-performance anomaly detection via implementing Digital Twin technologies in a dynamic industrial edge/cloud network.

The procedure of computerized twin begins by gathering real time data, processed data, and operational data and performs distinctive investigation which helps in anticipating the future. This additionally enhances the customer experiences by giving a digital feel of their product. The objective behind all these is the job of gathering information and putting them in a place, i.e., the cloud which could store exorbitant data. The user experience gets enhanced by the intervention of digital twin technology which could help in the successful working of the products geographically distributed. The impact of Internet of Things and Cloud Computing lifts up the digital twin. The information gathered from the sources can be arranged in terms of utilization and prospect to change on a timely basis. These data, as they are stored require proper coordination and a legitimate use. Digital Twin innovation assumes incredible opportunities in the field of manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities, automobile and so on. The effect of having a digital twin for the product makes it simple for activities and recognize the blemishes, if any happened.

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a certain product, such as fresh horticultural produce. This twin is linked to the real-world product by sensors supplying data of the environmental conditions near the target fruit or vegetable. Statistical and data-driven twins quantify how quality loss of fresh horticultural produce occurs by grasping patterns in the data. Physics-based twins provide an augmented insight into the underlying physical, biochemical, microbiological and physiological processes, enabling to explain also why this quality loss occurs. Scope and approach We identify what the key advantages are of digital twins and how the supply chain of fresh horticultural produce can benefit from them in the future. Key findings and conclusions A digital twin has a huge potential to help horticultural produce to tell its history as it drifts along throughout its postharvest life. The reason is that each shipment is subject to a unique and unpredictable set of temperature and gas atmosphere conditions from farm to consumer. Digital twins help to identify the resulting, largely uncharted, postharvest evolution of food quality. The benefit of digital twins particularly comes forward for perishable species and at low airflow rates. Digital twins provide actionable data for exporters, retailers, and consumers, such as the remaining shelf life for each shipment, on which logistics decisions and marketing strategies can be based. The twins also help diagnose and predict potential problems in supply chains that will reduce food quality and induce food loss.

The objective of HAM is to combine physics-based modeling (PBM) and data-driven modeling (DDM) to create generalizable, trustworthy, accurate, computationally efficient and self-evolving models. CoSTA achieves this objective by augmenting the governing equation of a PBM model with a corrective source term generated using a deep neural network. In a series of numerical experiments on one-dimensional heat diffusion, CoSTA is found to outperform comparable DDM and PBM models in terms of accuracy – often reducing predictive errors by several orders of magnitude – while also generalizing better than pure DDM. Due to its flexible but solid theoretical foundation, CoSTA provides a modular framework for leveraging novel developments within both PBM and DDM. Its theoretical foundation also ensures that CoSTA can be used to model any system governed by (deterministic) partial differential equations. Moreover, CoSTA facilitates interpretation of the DNN-generated source term within the context of PBM, which results in improved explainability of the DNN. These factors make CoSTA a potential door-opener for data-driven techniques to enter high-stakes applications previously reserved for pure PBM.",false,2022-02-28,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608021004494,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Blakseth, Sindre Stenen'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Rasheed, Adil'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Kvamsdal, Trond'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'San, Omer'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0893608021004494'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608021004494'}]",,application/json,Full,S0893-6080(21)00449-4,The Author(s).

In order to reduce the delay caused by the solution as much as possible, starting from the type of excitation source, an electric field equivalent method for AC/DC hybrid electric equipment adapted to digital twin with low latency is proposed: electrostatic field equivalent is used under power frequency AC or impulse voltage excitation, and constant electric field equivalent is used under typical DC voltage at the converter station.

Here, knowledge is transferred from one lifecycle phase to another in order to reduce the amount of data or time needed to train a machine learning algorithm. Looking at common challenges in developing and deploying industrial machinery with deep learning functionalities, embracing this concept would offer several advantages: Using an intelligent Digital Twin, learning algorithms can be designed, configured and tested in the design phase before the physical system exists and real data can be collected. Once real data becomes available, the algorithms must merely be fine-tuned, significantly speeding up commissioning and reducing the probability of costly modifications. Furthermore, using the Digital Twin’s simulation capabilities virtually injecting rare faults in order to train an algorithm’s response or using reinforcement learning, e.g. to teach a robot, become practically feasible.

Patient Timeline is one such use case for mitigating and reducing patient suffering from missed opportunities and paying special attention to moment that matters by all involved in providing care to patient.

Effective early warning algorithm is essential for mitigating the damage caused by battery failure. An early warning algorithm needs to be trained by failure data. However, building battery failure data (such as internal short circuit) by experiment consumes so much time and cost that it cannot match the development requirement of new product. This work demonstrates the validity of using digital twin technique to generate battery failure data to train the online early warning algorithm. The digital twin is formed by a highly reliable thermal-electrical coupled battery model. The influential factors, e.g., load current, short circuit position, equivalent short resistance and environment temperature, which determine the performance of the early warning algorithm were discussed. The warning threshold that may judge the fault warning rate and response speed of the algorithm was also analyzed. The digital twin helps us find that there is a temperature difference between the sensor location and the failure (short circuit) point. The temperature difference enlarges under the cases that the failure point is far from the measurement point, thereby hindering the timely detection and alarm for fault. The temperature gap can be as high as 261.2 °C under the extreme case of 0.1 Ω short circuit resistance. Therefore, the mismatch of the failure point and the measurement will give us the illusion that the failure occurs suddenly, or the so-called sudden death. The thermal runaway boundary for battery module varies with the ambient temperature and the short resistance, helping the determination of the threshold of the detection algorithm for thermal runaway. At last, a guidance on how to develop fault diagnosis algorithm with the help of digital twin to judgement of fault diagnosis threshold is summarized, with clear discussion of the accuracy, cost and efficiency of the method. The proposed method paves a way for the application of the digital twin on the fast development of battery management algorithms.",false,2023-08-01,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352152X23005108,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Yuan, Zhuchen'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Pan, Yue'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wang, Huaibin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wang, Shuyu'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Peng, Yong'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Jin, Changyong'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Xu, Chengshan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Feng, Xuning'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Shen, Kai'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Zheng, Yuejiu'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Zhang, Zhendong'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Ouyang, Minggao'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352152X23005108'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X23005108'}]",,application/json,,S2352-152X(23)00510-8,Published by Elsevier Ltd.,Fault data generation of lithium ion batteries based on digital twin: A case for internal short circuit,© 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.,0,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Energy storage'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Lithium-ion battery'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Digital twin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Internal short circuit'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Thermal runaway'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Fault diagnosis'}]",false,Journal of Energy Storage,,107113,,fla,1 August 2023,10.1016/j.est.2023.107113,107113,doi:10.1016/j.est.2023.107113,,2352152X,64,,,,107113,

A digital twin is a virtual copy of a physical system that emulates its behaviour to predict failures and opportunities for change, prescribe actions in real-time, and optimise and/or mitigate unexpected events. Modelling the virtual copy of a physical system is a rather complex task and requires the availability of a large amount of information and a set of accurate models that adequately represent the reality to model. At present, the modelling depends on the specific use case. Hence, the need to design a modelling solution suitable for virtual reality modelling in the context of a digital twin. The paper proposes a new approach to design a DT by endeavouring the concept of ""modelling patterns"" and their invariance property. Modelling patterns are here thought of as data-driven, as they can be derived autonomously from data using a specific approach devised to reach an invariance feature, to allow these to be used (and re-used) in modelling situations and/or problems with any given degree of similarity. The potentialities of invariance modelling patterns are proved here by the grace of a real industrial application, where a dedicated DT has been built using the approach proposed here.",false,2023-02-28,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452414X22000917,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Semeraro, Concetta'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Lezoche, Mario'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Panetto, Hervé'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Dassisti, Michele'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452414X22000917'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452414X22000917'}]",,application/json,,S2452-414X(22)00091-7,Elsevier Inc.,Data-driven invariant modelling patterns for digital twin design,© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The system is composed by three main modules: a core containing the simulation engine, a data interface managing incoming data and a graphical interface enabling user remote control. It receives as input the process data collected by several sensors and the same part program (G-Code file) used by the real machine; thus, the system provides various real time functions for process monitoring, condition monitoring and geometrical accuracy control. Alongside detecting load on critical components and checking wear and tear, it can also systematically sort data collected or calculated during operation to help in optimizing printing parameters. Through interaction with the print host software, the twin is able to intervene directly in the current process to pause printing in case of anomalies and to assist users along a recovery procedure. An index of quality of the printed piece is obtained by comparing the CAD model of the printed part and a 3D model of the deposited material powered by the data coming from the machine. The system has been tested on a custom-made Cartesian printer: a number of prints were made with different speeds and accelerations to assess the impact of these settings on the average quality, and a more in-depth study was carried out on the digital models of the prints to investigate the origin of the defects detected.

Furthermore, little research on DT has been conducted for the process industry, which may be explained by the high complexity of accurately representing and modeling the physics behind production processes. To consolidate the fragmented literature on the enabling factors and challenges in DT implementation in the process industry, this study organizes the existing studies on DTs with a focus on barriers and enablers.

One building block are production environments that plan and control their production flow autonomously and decentrally. To this end, all machines and systems (so-called “assets”) need to communicate with each other and derive suitable actions based on the exchanged information. Therefore, all assets need to be represented in the virtual world. This can be realized with digital twins. A concrete implementation of digital twins is the asset administration shell, which comprises all the assets’ properties and the endpoint of the corresponding asset, so intercommunication is possible. Here, the challenges comprise establishing a manufacturer-independent vocabulary that standardizes the assets’ properties and enabling the machines and systems to interpret this vocabulary semantically. Existing standards and information models represent only a fraction of the information requirements (i.e., terms) in this domain, making autonomous production planning and control (PPC) challenging to implement. Furthermore, the information requirements of the machines and peripheral assets as well as the corresponding information flows are insufficiently defined. Therefore, this contribution aims to build a comprehensive vocabulary for the domain of PPC, which serves as a basis for standardized asset administration shells that realize machine-to-machine communication. In particular, PPC processes concerning the injection molding domain’s characteristics are considered since the interaction between the domain’s assets, i.e., injection molding machines, molds, peripheral assets, raw materials, and operators, are especially complex. For this purpose, the relevant input and output information within the injection molding domain was first collected for each process step in PPC. After that, a UML class diagram was modeled under consideration of established standards. The result of this work is an ontology, which can be used as a dictionary for the PPC in the injection molding domain and as a foundation of standardized digital twins in the form of asset administration shells.",false,2023-10-31,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452414X23000614,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Sapel, Patrick'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Hopmann, Christian'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2452414X23000614'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452414X23000614'}]",,application/json,Full,S2452-414X(23)00061-4,The Authors.

Then the process and supportive features of Digital Twin for Industry 4.0 are diagrammatically discussed, and finally, the major applications of Digital Twin for Industry 4.0 are identified. Digital Twin sophistication depends on the process or product represented and the data available. Manufacturers can learn how assets will behave in real-time, in the physical world, by putting sensors on particular assets, gathering data, creating digital duplicates, and employing machine intelligence. They can confidently make wise judgments, which helps improve company performance. Digital Twin assesses material usage to save costs, discover inefficiencies, replicate tool tracking systems, and do other things. Manufacturers construct a digital clone for specific equipment and tools, exclusive products or systems, entire procedures, or anything else they want to improve on the factory floor. Sensors and other equipment that collect real-time data on the state of the process or product collect this information, which on the other hand, must be handled and processed appropriately.

A scaled long-span cable-stayed bridge and its shake table tests are taken as an example. Three finite element (FE) models of the bridge, including a design document-based FE model, a linearly updated FE model, and a nonlinearly updated FE model, are established to demonstrate the necessity of the digital twin-based assessment. Incremental dynamic analyses (IDA) are conducted to calculate the collapse fragility curves of the FE models. The assessment results are compared with the test results in terms of collapse mechanisms, collapse ground motion intensities, and collapse probabilities.

Mantell in 1969 and my doctoral work in Nancy where I learned fixed-bed processes and mechanistic models. Then I mention the creation of my research group at the U. Porto and the organization of four NATO Advanced Study Institute bringing top researchers in the area as well as the origin of the International Adsorption Society and the Fundamentals of Adsorption conferences. In Section 2, I focus on lessons learned mentioning what is important to understand batch isothermal adsorption (adsorption equilibrium isotherm, operating line, LDF kinetic model) and fixed-bed processes, namely the concept of compressive and dispersive concentration waves resulting from De Vault equation (1943). Going from batch to continuous processes is illustrated with the case of Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) technology. In Section 3 I suggest a roadmap for the development of adsorption processes and sorption-enhanced reaction processes (SERP) combining experiments and process simulation, with reference to the importance of IAST theory in predicting multicomponent adsorption equilibrium, shaping and 3D printing of materials and the contribution of molecular simulation both for the screening of adsorbents and prediction of adsorption isotherms and transport properties. Finally in section 4, I discuss some challenges and opportunities related with difficult separations and the relevant choice of materials and processes together. I believe that in this time of transition from fossil energy to renewables many existing technologies will find a place in future biorefineries. Some references are made to CCUS and Power to Gas processes as an example of SERP.

First, three types of deep neural networks are created with optionally used autoencoders as surrogate models, with architectures and data processing inspired by the rule-of-mixture of composites. Second, the prediction accuracy and efficiency are evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, demonstrating the feasibility of predicting 3D displacement and stress fields directly from sensing data of temperature, pressure and loading displacement, and the optimal architecture is selected to be the evolving digital twin. Finally, the real-time interactive experiments are relayed to the digital twin and demonstrated that it can interact with physical objects and evolve online with high accuracy.

Particularly to the aim the unsupervised machine learning approach and the digital twin concept in form of pressurized water reactor 2-loop simulator are used. This innovative methodology is based on neural network algorithm that makes capable to predict failures of plant structure, system, and components earlier than the activation of safety and emergency systems. Moreover, to match the objective of the study several scenarios of loss of cooling accident (LOCA) of different break size were simulated. To make the acquisition platform realistic, Gaussian noise was added to the input signals. The neural network has been fed by synthetic dataset provide by PCTRAN simulator and the efficiency in event identification was studied. Further, due to the very limited studies on the unsupervised anomaly detection by means of autoencoder neural networks applied for plant monitoring and surveillance, the methodology has been validated with experimental data from resonant test rig designed for fatigue testing of tubular components.

In addition to growing concerns about sustainability, stringent government regulation, food security, and traceability issues force the managers, industries, and practitioners working in AFSC to adopt new tools, techniques, and methodology to model current food supply chain issues and correspondingly design the food logistics network. To this effect, the purpose of this article is threefold: the first focus is to identify the various challenges in AFSC, second is to review the research contribution in the field of designing agro-food supply chain network (AFSCN), while the third aspect is to investigate performance measurement system of AFSC through various performance indicators. For this, 108 articles are reviewed, and the main research findings are discussed in different aspects. Technology adoption and integration in design AFSCN are exciting prospects for future AFSC research.

The objective of this work is to present a new approach to create a machine learning-based digital twin of banana fruit to monitor its quality changes throughout storage. The thermal camera has been used as a data acquisition tool due to its capability to detect the surface and physiological changes of fruits throughout the storage. In this study, after constructing the dataset of thermal data belonging to four classes, the training of the model has been performed using intelligent technologies from SAP. The solution has applied a deep convolutional neural network to monitor the fruit status based on the thermal information, and the training process has shown higher accuracy. Thus, 99% of prediction accuracy has been achieved which is proved to be a promising technique for the development of fruit digital twins.

With respect to the existing literature models, a simplified methodology to account for diffraction forces is proposed, together with a novel approach for the estimation of the transom effects on drag and lift forces. A throughout comparison of model results with literature data of different planing hulls is presented, showing the potential of the proposed methodology.

Here we address this issue in the context of a dynamic and stochastic patient transportation problem, where besides considering new events, we also incorporate stochastic information about future events. We propose different anticipatory algorithms and investigate which algorithm performs best according to the given settings in a real-world application. We therefore address different types of dynamic events, appropriate response times, and the synchronization of real-world data with the plan. In order to test and analyze how the algorithms behave and perform, we apply the concept of a digital twin. The implemented anticipatory algorithms compared here are a sample scenario planning approach and two waiting strategies. The question of the value of more sophisticated algorithms compared to algorithms with less computational effort is investigated. The experimental results show that solution quality benefits from incorporating information about future requests, and that simple waiting strategies prove most suitable for such a highly dynamic environment. We find that in highly stochastic environments, a rescheduling should be done whenever a new event occurs, whereas in less stochastic environments it is better to let the optimization engine run a bit longer and not start reoptimization after every new event.",false,2022-09-01,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377221721009231,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Ritzinger, Ulrike'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Puchinger, Jakob'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Rudloff, Christian'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Hartl, Richard F.'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377221721009231'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221721009231'}]",,application/json,Full,S0377-2217(21)00923-1,The Author(s).

The activities have also resulted in publications, including two books and two review papers. Initial activities focused on round robins providing test methods for determination of fracture properties for, e.g., technical data sheets, quality assurance, materials selection, or materials development and optimization and materials modelling. These procedures defined standard specimens, test rigs and test conditions. For polymers, standards for specific ranges of loading rate and for composites and adhesively bonded joints, procedures for different loading modes and mode mixes were developed. Recently, standard composite specimens with unidirectional fiber orientation were shown to overestimate the delamination resistance of multidirectional laminates under cyclic fatigue loading. First round robin data from the environmental stress cracking tests show the potential for discriminating between the different susceptibilities of polymers to environmentally induced fracture. Future activities will include elastomeric materials, simulation and modelling in combination with experiments or prediction of fracture behavior.

This analysis can also perform predictive maintenance and estimate efficiency levels. This paper follows a systematic approach and inspects the current state of digital twin adoption by the Oil and Gas industry, along with cloud and edge utilization in both scenarios. The survey was conducted by filtering and selecting articles published in three different queries regarding digital twins in the Oil and Gas industry, cloud and edge usage in digital twins, and cloud and edge usage in the Oil and Gas industry. The selected articles were classified and reviewed to present an overview of the current literature regarding digital twins in the oil and gas industry and evaluate cloud-based solutions for digital twins in this context. This review found that cloud and edge adoption in the Oil and Gas industry was late compared to other industries, mainly because of security and data privacy concerns. Digital twin adoption across all industries is still in its infancy, as most of the current works are theoretical or present partial implementations, which often follow different digital twin definitions.

While Digital twin (DT) has been discussed in some literature for possible SWG applications, there has been limited, or no technical framework developed to facilitate SWG operation and management. In this paper, a generic framework is developed for constructing SWG high fidelity Digital Twin (DT) by integrating digital thread with various digital models for visualization, data-driven analysis, physics-based simulations, and decision-making support. Both the physics-based models and data-driven models are trained/retrained and calibrated/re-calibrated respectively by using the data collected with the sensors installed throughout a SWG. The information derived from the SWG DT can be diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive to significantly augment users’ intelligence for improving SWG operation and management. One important application of digital twin augmented intelligence is illustrated to timely detect and localize anomaly events, which may include, but not be limited to, pipe bursts and unauthorized water usages. The solution is tested on the selected areas in Singapore to construct the ever-green DT by calibrating and recalibrating the models for near real-time SWG operation management. The case study was conducted for three supply zones with the total pipeline length of more than 1000 km and 40 weeks of monitoring data, collected by 89 pressure monitoring stations and 8 flow meters at inlets and boundary.

The concept is called “magnetofriction” and is studied on a sandwich structure in the present work. The assembled structure consists of a MAE core and ferromagnetic skins. Due to the magnetization of the MAE, the skins are attracted to the core and the sandwich is assembled without the need of glue or other means of fixation. The magnetic forces generate the normal loading in the contact interfaces between skins and core while a tangential loading is induced by forced vibrations applied to the sandwich beam. Random and harmonic vibration tests reveal the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the sandwich structure and highlight the damping capacity of magnetofriction. The harmonic balance method is used on a nonlinear dynamic model of the system to identify the parameters related to the resonance frequency and damping ratio. The results obtained from the identification state damping ratios up to 9% under harmonic excitation, which is remarkable for friction damping. In addition, a Finite Element-based model of the structure is implemented to study the local contact states in the sandwich. Multi-physical simulations are performed to analyze the magnetic and mechanical loading in the contact interface.

In order to fill this gap, a bio-inspired LIDA cognitive-based Digital Twin architecture is proposed, so as to achieve unmanned maintenance of machine tools through a self-constructed, self-evaluated, and self-optimized manner. A three phases process in the architecture, including the physical phase, virtual phase, and service phase, is further introduced to support the cognitive cycle for unmanned maintenance of machine tools.

First, the development of the alignment of ship propulsion shaft systems is outlined, and the calculation methods are summarised according to different alignment principles in two directions: static and dynamic.

Both the methods are discussed detailedly, including the basic principles, constraints, advantages, and limitations. Then, propulsion shafting dynamic characteristics, such as bearing loads, bending moments, and bending angles, are described under various uncertainties.

In practice, it is challenging for 3D modelling of subsurface stratigraphy in an underground digital twin due to insufficient site-specific measurements and a lack of efficient 3D spatial prediction tools. In this study, a data-driven and deep learning method, called IC-XGBoost3D, is proposed to build a 3D geological model from limited site-specific boreholes and 2D training images reflecting prior geological knowledge. Anisotropic stratigraphic relationships are learned from two perpendicular 2D training images, and the extracted stratigraphic statistics serve as the input for pre-training a 2D simulation slice. A sequence of 2D simulation slices is then simulated with constraints by site-specific boreholes and subsequently reassembled into a 3D geological model. Note that the parameters of the deep learning method are calibrated with site-specific data and prior training images before being applied to develop the geological model. The model performance is demonstrated and validated using an illustrative example. The proposed method can efficiently generate an anisotropic 3D geological model as a point cloud from two perpendicular training images and sparse boreholes with a high prediction accuracy. More importantly, the proposed method not only infers the most probable 3D geological domain, but also provides a quantitative evaluation of associated 3D stratigraphic uncertainty. Effects of irregular borehole spacing and single training image on the simulation performance are also investigated.",false,2022-08-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088677982200133X,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Shi, Chao'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wang, Yu'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088677982200133X'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088677982200133X'}]",,application/json,,S0886-7798(22)00133-X,Elsevier Ltd.,Data-driven construction of Three-dimensional subsurface geological models from limited Site-specific boreholes and prior geological knowledge for underground digital twin,© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a methodology for predicting necessary interventions and presents a database of inspection information for tunnels. The model developed correlates performance loss, measured by the tunnel serviceability index (TSI), to defects detected through a 2D grid composed of classified unit cells converted into a virtual representation. To support the framework developed, intervention time estimates were compared to stochastic degradation models presented in the literature. A limit analysis was performed using inverse exponential equations, utilizing data from different sources and supported by a digital representation of the analysis structure. This was done to estimate times with unitary inspection data, deterioration mapping control, and data connection to the developed inspection model. A railway tunnel for ore transport in northern Brazil was selected as a case study to apply the forecast model, as it showed an accelerated deterioration process within a few years of service. The tunnel was divided into four sections that were analyzed using the methodology developed through inspection-sensitive analysis. The section with the lowest service level (TS 1) matched the geological-geotechnical mapping, which indicated a rock mass with high metamorphic grade and susceptibility to weathering agents. The digital model resulted in an inspection digital twin (IDT) prototype that maps the zones with the greatest problems regarding the degradation process. Metadata is assigned to control elements, and there is online connection to a visual database of the tunnel. The target intervention time was set at 16 years by the developed structure, which falls within all forecast intervals calculated by the limit analyses.

In product lifecycle, there are many participators constructing a complicated network with enormous product lifecycle data. It is difficult to manage data of digital twin efficiently and securely from the perspectives of data storage, data access, data sharing, and data authenticity among the complicated network. Moreover, the virtual product is always updated to the latest state of the physical product by overwriting the history virtual product that records the development process of digital twin. To address abovementioned data management problems simultaneously, a data management method for digital twin of product based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. A peer-to-peer network is constructed to enhance data sharing efficiency among participators. The basic structure of blockchain is introduced, including block, chain, and transaction. The blockchain is used for data storage through cryptography that ensuring only eligible participators can access the corresponding data. The change sensitive characteristic of blockchain can ensure data authenticity as well.

A system like that would connect the DC resources, such as solar energy, to DC busses and the AC resources, such as wind turbines, to AC busses. Therefore, the system's overall performance is remarkably improved. In addition, it is cost-effective compared to traditional grids since no power electronics are required to convert DC to AC. While a system like this has numerous benefits, it also has numerous challenges. System-level energy management (EM), for example, presents greater challenges because each change in the subsystem (DC/AC sections) may potentially alter the EM for the whole grid. Therefore, the present study develops the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) for finding the optimum solution. Additionally, blockchain (BC) technology has been applied for increasing the security of power trading in hybrid MGs (HMGs). Stochastic load flow, according to a copula model, is used to create a realistic layout.

Virtual sensing, in combination with physical sensors, has great potential in establishing a reliable and informative sensing environment. However, physical sensors can experience hardware errors or systematic errors due to the working environment within building systems. Virtual sensors are also subject to their model uncertainties arising from input physical sensor errors and changes in system operations. These virtual sensor errors have a negative effect on the in-situ calibration accuracy of corresponding physical sensors. To address these issues, this study proposes a simultaneous in-situ calibration (SIC) method designed to calibrate multiple physical and virtual sensors with varying errors in the context of digital twins. The SIC problem is mathematically formulated, including two types of distance functions (direct and indirect) and defining correction functions to calibrate various types of virtual sensors (such as backup, validation, replacement/virtualization, and observation sensors). Importantly, the proposed method tackles the challenges posed by the unknown calibration environment in operational systems. A field application study was conducted for two physical sensors and three different virtual sensors operating in a district heating substation serving real residential buildings in Korea. The case study shows how the different calibration accuracies for each sensor depend on the calibration approaches, such as physical-targeted (existing Case 1), virtual-targeted (existing Case 2), and simultaneous calibration (novel Case 3). Under the simultaneous errors, only Case 3 satisfied the reference accuracy for all sensors. Specifically, the average MAEs in Case 3 were improved by approximately 79.3%, 75.3%, 63.9%, and 87.5% for the target physical sensor, backup virtual sensor, virtualized sensor, and validation virtual sensor, respectively, compared to the accuracies before calibration. These results demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of simultaneous in-situ calibration of physical and virtual sensors in digital twin-enabled building operations. The proposed calibration can contribute to the synchronization of physical and virtual building systems, thus achieving reliable and informative virtual sensing-driven digital twins.",false,2024-01-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1474034623003671,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Koo, Jabeom'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Yoon, Sungmin'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1474034623003671'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474034623003671'}]",,application/json,,S1474-0346(23)00367-1,Elsevier Ltd.,Simultaneous in-situ calibration for physical and virtual sensors towards digital twin-enabled building operations,© 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

The cost-effective development and manufacture of such electronic modules are critical to maintaining the competitiveness of high-wage manufacturing countries. Therefore, two approaches suggest themselves: Design for Manufacturing (DfM) and manufacturing optimization. To apply both approaches in industry, it is necessary to introduce models that describe the relationship between process input and process output. Applied to electronics manufacturing processes, this means that design, process parameters, and material properties must be mapped to process quality criteria in end-of-line testing. Recently, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been emerging and dominating other modeling methods such as numerical simulation. To develop such complex ML models, a unified data structure for each input and output must be defined. This paper proposes an extensible ML-enabled framework that provides direct and structured access to the printed circuit board (PCB) design and process parameters. This framework is used to perform structured data acquisition using a custom data mining board. During the manufacturing of these PCBs on a full surface mount technology (SMT) process line, all available process machine-level data is collected, archived, and parsed into a uniform, standardized, and flat data structure. This enables fast analysis of the correlation between inputs and quality criteria, direct access by ML algorithms, and training of models. Through these measures, the quality of the framework is validated and correlations are revealed and compared to previous literature.

However, the production system cognition faces the problems of state coupling, state dynamic transfer and transition, and multi-system interweaving, which makes the production system cognition face huge challenges. Combining technologies such as the Internet of Things, industrial big data, and artificial intelligence, cognitive manufacturing can realize dynamic cognition of the production process, support dynamic adjustment, and become a promising way to solve the dynamic changes and uncertainties of production systems.

Firstly, with the help of digital twin technology, we build digital twin models for crowdsourcing tasks and workers in digital twin layer of platform. And we formulate a Multi-round Workers recruitment and Task scheduling with Precedence constraints (MWTP) problem with the object of minimizing task completion time (makespan) to model the above challenging issue in crowdsourcing computing. The MWTP problem can be divided into two sub-problems, the task scheduling sub-problem and the worker recruitment sub-problem.

Specifically, for the task scheduling sub-problem, we first propose a priority-driven based task scheduling (PDTS) approximation algorithm to produce a primary solution with an explicit approximation ratio. Then a DETS algorithm is proposed to use the solution of PDTS for initialization and generate a better solution that further improves the performance. For the unknown workers recruitment sub-problem, we use the Combinatorial Multi-Arm Bandit framework to model this, and propose CWR method to learn the computational capabilities of workers while maintaining good performance during multiple rounds of worker recruitment by adding a tuning term to balanced exploration and exploitation. Finally, verified by extensive comparison experiments, the CMRS scheme can achieve the best performance of makespan compared with the baselines in most cases.",false,2024-06-01,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957417423034164,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Teng, Haojun'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Liu, Anfeng'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Gui, Jinsong'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Song, Houbing'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wang, Tian'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Zhang, Shaobo'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957417423034164'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423034164'}]",,application/json,,S0957-4174(23)03416-4,Elsevier Ltd.,CMRS: A digital twin enabled workers recruitment and task scheduling scheme for future crowdsourcing networks under precedence constraints,© 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the complexity and variability of the ocean, accurate environment modeling and flexible path planning algorithms are pivotal challenges. The traditional models mainly utilize mathematical functions, which are not complete and reliable. Most existing path planning algorithms depend on the environment and lack flexibility. To overcome these challenges, we propose a path planning system for underwater intelligent internet vehicles. It applies digital twins and sensor data to map the real ocean environment to a virtual digital space, which provides a comprehensive and reliable environment for path simulation. We design a value-based reinforcement learning path planning algorithm and explore the optimal network structure parameters. The path simulation is controlled by a closed-loop model integrated into the terminal vehicle through edge computing. The integration of state input enriches the learning of neural networks and helps to improve generalization and flexibility. The task-related reward function promotes the rapid convergence of the training. The experimental results prove that our reinforcement learning based path planning algorithm has great flexibility and can effectively adapt to a variety of different ocean conditions.",false,2022-05-14,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352864822000967,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Yang, Jiachen'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Xi, Meng'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wen, Jiabao'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Li, Yang'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Song, Houbing Herbert'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352864822000967'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352864822000967?v=s5'}]",,application/json,Full,S2352-8648(22)00096-7,Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

In line with this trend, South Korea has applied digital twins to land systems. To this end, a pilot project has been performed in Jeonju city. This study reviews digital twins and land conceptually and analyses the case in Jeonju. Conceptually, in terms of effective policy decision support, digital twins and land have shared characteristics, encompassing physical land, virtual land, and land-related data. The case of Jeonju city has been reviewed in terms of the relationship between digital twins and land. In the process of collection and renewal of data from physical land, systematic data-management systems and collaboration among related departments and/or persons in charge are important. In terms of processing for digitalization in the virtual space, sufficient budget and human resource management have been identified as important elements. As for analysis and simulation conducted in the virtual space, trust in the model of analysis and simulation needs to be developed through verification and job rotation in the civil service; without proper transfer of duties and responsibilities, this could be an obstacle.

Digital twin-driven manufacturing system with human-robot collaboration is a typical paradigm of intelligent manufacturing. When production task changes, manufacturing system reconfiguration with dynamic opeartion task allocation between operator (human) and robot is a key manner to maintain the production efficiency of intelligent manufacturing system with human-robot collaboration. However, the differences between operator and robot are neglected during reconfiguration of manufacturing system with human-robot collaboration. To promote the reconfiguration accuracy and production efficiency, a dynamic reconfiguration optimization method of intelligent manufacturing system with human-robot collaboration based on digital twin is proposed in this paper, which the different characteristics between operator and robot are considered during reconfiguration optimiztion.

Demand is continually fluctuating, and the pressure for new sustainable processes and products is rising. New environmental regulations are always expanding and becoming less harmonized globally, and customers are demanding sustainable products that are friendly to the environment. To follow all the market changes and remain competitive, companies need to invest in capital projects to develop new processes and products. However, since it's a capital-intensive industry, new investments in capital projects need to be carefully managed. Today, companies need to find ways to be more efficient in the execution of the engineering projects. One way is to compress engineering cycles and adapt processes and products to comply with sustainable KPIs and new demands. The Unified Engineering methodology is one option enabled by the latest technologies and tools available. For decades, engineering to design and build industrial plants has been developed through projects with a complex and highly iterative workflow, using siloed solutions. The entire process is very time consuming, and the final deliverable to the owner of the operation is a set of documents (P&IDs, datasheets, 3D model, etc.) with disperse data, with no guarantee of consistency. In order to compress engineering cycles, a data-centric approach must be used. With this approach, documents and applications are always kept up to date with the latest validated data. The data-centric approach is the first step to apply the Unified Engineering methodology, which will evolve later to the plant Digital Twin. The Unified Engineering methodology uses a single source of information that is available for all the teams involved in the project. Drawings, steady-state and dynamic process simulations, line lists, datasheets, 3D models, and isometrics, among others, are regularly updated with the data available in the unified source of information. Engineers become more efficient and work with reliable information as documents and models are updated in a controlled way as soon as any change is made. For even greater sustainability and effectiveness, the best way is to use the Unified Engineering methodology in the cloud. The cloud enables higher degrees of flexibility and collaboration among people working from different locations, which means that always the most appropriate resources can be allocated for each part of the project. Unified Engineering reduces capital project costs, risks, and delays enabling shorter engineering cycles required to deliver new sustainable projects.

And the digital twin runs on a competent IT infrastructure (say, cloud centers). In essence, a digital twin is typically a software program that takes various real-world data about a ground-level physical system as prospective inputs and produces useful outputs in the form of insights. The outputs generally are the value-adding and decision-enabling predictions or simulations of how that physical system will act on those inputs. These help in quickly and easily realizing highly optimized and organized products with less cost and risk. The manufacturing industry had embraced the digital twin technology long time back to be modern in their operations, outputs, and offerings. The distinct contributions of the digital twin paradigm, since then, have gone up significantly with the seamless synchronization with a number of pioneering technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), big and streaming data analytics, data lakes, software-defined cloud environments, blockchain, etc. With the concept of cyber physical systems (CPS) is being adopted and adapted widely and wisely, complicated yet sophisticated electronics devices at the ground level are being blessed with their corresponding digital twins. The digital twins enable data scientists and system designers to optimize a number of things including process excellence, knowledge discovery and dissemination in time, better system design, robust verification and validation, etc. In the recent past, with the flourishing of the blockchain technology, the scope for digital twins has gone up remarkably.

Usually all maintenance information is documented analogously and transferred to the corresponding management systems with a certain delay after the inspection. The time delay can lead to data loss and errors and can also occur during transmission to an appropriate system. In the future, the maintenance data and changes to the real object should be determined digital and transferred to the data management system in real time. A digital twin should enable the unambiguous assignment of the data to the corresponding elements and thus represent a virtual representation of the AS-IS state of the industrial plant. The required process data will be collected in Mixed Reality and then transferred to a PDM-System. To transfer the data records without loss, a system model can be used as an interface between the Microsoft HoloLens mixed reality device and the PDM system.

With the increasing application of digital twin to various engineering fields, an effective method of modeling a multi-dimensional digital twin at the conceptual level is required. To such an end, this paper presents a method for the conceptual modeling of a digital twin based on a five-dimensional digital twin framework to represent the complex relationship between digital twin objects and their attributes. The proposed method was used to model the digital twin of an intelligent vehicle at the concept level.",false,2021-01-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278612520301163,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wu, Chunlong'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Zhou, Youcheng'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Pereia Pessôa, Marcus Vinicius'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Peng, Qingjin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Tan, Runhua'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278612520301163'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278612520301163'}]",,application/json,,S0278-6125(20)30116-3,The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

However, for the local three-dimensional fluid dynamic problems in complex reactor system, traditional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) methods are severely limited by the solution efficiency and accuracy. This study proposed a rapid flow field prediction method based on singular value decomposition (SVD) and deep learning. The raw flow field snapshot data was compressed using SVD to extract low-dimensional features, and the deep neural network was used to construct a flow field reduced-order model to achieve rapid flow field prediction. A benchmark problem of flow around a cylinder was selected to assess the efficacy of this method. Furtherly, this method was applied in the three-dimensional flow field simulations of the fuel assembly. The results demonstrated that the reduced-order model (ROM) error was less than 6% compared with that of the CFD model, and the time consumption was less than 1% of that of the CFD model.

The initial insight was that the mutual information generated in the interactions between the available vision models and real-world perceptions could decrease the uncertainty of sensing-action processes. Further, the real-time interactive information gains and visual templates constitute the digital twin through bidirectional data flowing and real-time optimization. As a demonstration of concept, on the conveyor-based and vision-guided robotic grasping platform, the robotic grasping experiments of freely placed and moving parts were performed. Experimental results indicated that the autonomous and real-time optimization of the conveyor-based and vision-guided robotic grasping system happens and the adaptability to the real-world changes had been clearly increased.

It is offering a novel way to establish trust amongst multiple stakeholders without relying or trusting centralised authorities. While its use as a decentralised store of value has been validated through the emergence of cryptocurrencies, its use case in industrial applications with multiple stakeholder ecosystems such as industrial supply chain management, is still at an early stage of design and experimentation where private blockchains are used as opposed to public blockchains. Many enterprise blockchain projects failed to gain traction after initial launches, due to inefficient design, lack of incentives to all stakeholders or simply because the use of blockchain was not really necessary in the first place. There has been a need for a framework that allows blockchain designers and researchers to evaluate scenarios when a blockchain solution is useful and design the key configurations for an enterprise blockchain solution. Literature on blockchain architectures are sparse and only applicable to specific use cases or functionalities. This paper proposes a comprehensive Enterprise Blockchain Design Framework (EBDF), that not only identifies the relevant use cases when a blockchain must be utilised, but also details all the characteristics and configurations for designing an enterprise blockchain ecosystem, applicable to multiple industries. To validate the EBDF, we apply the same to the Vortal e-Procurement ecosystem allowing for multiple platforms to interoperate with greater transparency and accountability over the proposed blockchain framework. In this use case, many vendors bid for procurement procedures, often for publicly managed funds where it is extremely vital that full transparency and accountability is ensured in the entire process. Ensuring that certain digital certification functions, such as timestamps are independent from e-Procurement platform owners has been a challenge. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution for not only ensuring transparency and immutability of records, but also providing for interoperability across different platforms by acting as a trusted third-party. The applied framework is used to design a Hyperledger based blockchain solution with some of the key architectural elements that could fulfil these needs while presenting the advantages of such a solution.",false,2022-09-30,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360835222004107,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Nodehi, Tahereh'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Zutshi, Aneesh'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Grilo, Antonio'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Rizvanovic, Belma'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360835222004107'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835222004107'}]",,application/json,Full,S0360-8352(22)00410-7,The Authors.

Accordingly, the method of implementing DTMSIP is introduced by building Digital Twin mapping based on Twinning Entity (TE). Moreover, how the CPS-MES-DTMSIP architecture serves the RMS evolution is discussed by proposing the procedure of DTMSIP-driven RMS reconfiguration. To validate the proposed procedure, DTMSIP software is realised for an existing RMS using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). Through DTMSIP monitoring and simulation of planned RMS configurations, the performance of planned configurations is calculated, and the optimised configuration is obtained.",false,2023-10-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1474034623002690,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Leng, Bohan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Gao, Shuo'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Xia, Tangbin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Pan, Ershun'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Seidelmann, Joachim'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Wang, Hao'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Xi, Lifeng'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1474034623002690'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474034623002690'}]",,application/json,,S1474-0346(23)00269-0,Elsevier Ltd.,Digital twin monitoring and simulation integrated platform for reconfigurable manufacturing systems,© 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

However, researcher considered more requirements from product manufacturing/assemble stage, and less requirements from product operation stage. Identifying subsystems to be improved and risk analysis is two methods applied to product design considering the effect of failure at product operation stage. But these methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming tasks and need a lot of expert knowledge. There are huge amounts of data including inspection reports and maintenance records in product operation stage. These data can offer meaningful feedback on next-generation product design. The past few years, digital twin has gained considerable attention because it is characterized by two-way interactions between the digital and physical worlds. This paper proposes a digital twin (DT) framework for product to-be-designed analysis based on operation data. DT data is collected and store from the operation stage of current product. DT data is processed and analyzed to acquire the operation knowledge by Clustering algorithm, Frequent Pattern-growth algorithm, Multi-attribute decision-making, etc. The failure knowledge is used for the design of next-generation product. It can help designer to identify subsystems to be improved and offer the failure information for risk analysis. The failure knowledge also predicts the easily failure subsystems at operation stage of current product.

Consequently, modeling, validation, and implementation cycles become challenging and time-consuming. The reuse of existing digital twin models to achieve rapid transference and utilization of models is becoming one of the hot topics in digital twin modeling. To this effect, aiming at how to reuse the multi-dimensional information of existing models to improve modeling efficiency and resilience, this paper proposes a rapid transferable modeling approach for digital twin models. The approach proposes a unified mapping and digital representation of physical entities based on information metamodels, which can rapidly instantiate digital twin assets. Then, the transferable approaches from the geometry dimension, behavior dimension, and algorithm dimension are given respectively, which include the information model reuse, action feature query and rule generation, as well as fine-tuning of data-driven mechanisms and domain adaptive of digital twins.

The growing adoption of electric vehicles on the market has increased the demand for batteries that may have numerous manufacturers. Life expectancy is affected on manufacture, but also on operational conditions. A large number of parameters have a role on battery's health and thousands of data need to be evaluated and combined. The present work investigates the scenario of the battery industry in order to implement a blockchain-based platform for the supply chain implementation thus allowing a better control on performance of batteries and environmental impact. To achieve this goal, the authors carried out a systematic review with the following steps: identification of relevant studies, evaluation and summary of similar studies, comparison and extraction of data from the papers. The main motivation of this work is the use of the literature for justifying the use of the blockchain technology to track batteries and for identifying the main challenges in the related markets that can be addressed by this technology.

In-process quality assurance measures and, in particular, part inspection after production are time-consuming and cost-intensive. Most existing quality assurance approaches were developed for traditional manufacturing technologies like milling or turning and have been optimized over the years. Due to its unique process characteristics, these approaches will not easily translate to additive manufacturing. So, a new holistic approach for quality assurance in additive manufacturing is necessary for wider dissemination of additive manufacturing in all industry sectors. The Department of Computer Integrated Design at the TU Darmstadt sees digital twins in additive manufacturing as a promising approach to tackle these problems. This paper provides a building block for digital twin-based quality assurance by proposing a concept for a virtual part inspection. In this concept, data from product development and product manufacturing are combined to make predictions about the properties of the as-built part. The concept was developed under consideration of the digital twin architecture consisting of digital master and digital shadow and is integrated into the existing process chain for additive manufacturing.",false,2022-12-31,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212827122002918,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Krückemeier, Slim'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Anderl, Reiner'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212827122002918'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827122002918'}]",,application/json,Full,S2212-8271(22)00291-8,The Author(s).

The current error rate is reported to be approximately 35–40% reported cases of medical errors, and upwards of 60% if unreported errors are also included in Developing countries. The situation is slightly better in the developed world, but error rates are still at a very high level and this result in billions of dollars of fines, litigation, and unnecessary morbidity and mortality. Digital twin of Decision Support System (DSS) has lot of potential to help with reducing error rates in physician's decision making and can help with other inequalities in addition to mitigating or addressing biases and noises in Healthcare Delivery. Some of those inequalities are: 1. Timely access to trusted and reliable information. 2. Access to medical expertise. 3. Access to medical facilities and medical interventions, testing. 4. Access and maturity of public health system. 5. Ability to afford medical interventions (Self-funded vs Government funded). The time has come to leverage Digital Twins to create a diagnostic and prognostic system which can be used by clinicians in hospitals as another tool to validate and improve consistency as they provide personalized care to each patient with the goal of minimizing unavoidable sufferings (side effects etc.) and eliminating avoidable sufferings (Communication, follow-up, advise, consult, Next Best Action, and Long-term care considerations etc.). A use case for supporting Clinician with such system will be based on framework of Empathy, Compassion and Gratitude (Addressing why for Clinician) and Due Diligence, Doing the right thing, and thinking anew (addressing how for clinicians). Each clinician can work within this broad framework and can customize the decision support system to enable himself or herself to provide the best possible care to their patients. Hospitals can use this framework to provide better care to their patients and reduce accidents from knowledge gaps or human error.

However, the theoretical framework and practical implementations of digital twin (DT) are yet to fully achieve this vision at scale. Although an increasing number of successful implementations exist in research and industrial works, sufficient implementation details are not publicly available, making it difficult to fully assess their components and effectiveness, to draw comparisons, identify successful solutions, share lessons, and thus to jointly advance and benefit from the DT methodology. This work first presents a review of relevant DT research and industrial works, focusing on the key DT features, current approaches in different domains, and successful DT implementations, to infer the key DT components and properties, and to identify current limitations and reasons behind the delay in the widespread implementation and adoption of digital twin. This work identifies that the major reasons for this delay are: the fact the DT is still a fast evolving concept; the lack of a universal DT reference framework, e.g. DT standards are scarce and still evolving; problem- and domain-dependence; security concerns over shared data; lack of DT performance metrics; and reliance of digital twin on other fast-evolving technologies. Advancements in machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and big data have led to significant improvements in DT features such as real-time monitoring and accurate forecasting. Despite this progress and individual company-based efforts, certain research and implementation gaps exist in the field, which have so far prevented the widespread adoption of the DT concept and technology; these gaps are also discussed in this work. Based on reviews of past work and the identified gaps, this work then defines a conceptualisation of DT which includes its components and properties; these also validate the uniqueness of DT as a concept, when compared to similar concepts such as simulation, autonomous systems and optimisation. Real-life case studies are used to showcase the application of the conceptualisation.

These are defined as easily transportable and deployable nuclear systems which are designed to operate either unattended or autonomously. We start by defining the current landscape of domestic and international safeguards and security and discuss how it can be affected by the introduction of these new nuclear systems. We then specifically discuss the technology gaps and technologies to be developed to facilitate their practical deployment. The discussion is based on a commentary of experts' inputs collected during a workshop held as a part of the fission battery initiative. A commentary of experts' inputs discussing issues and gaps related to security and safeguards of fission batteries is provided. This input is categorized using qualitative coding of the text of the commentary of the experts’ inputs but without modifying the basic content. From there we find that, as expected, we can leverage conclusions from existing security and safeguards studies for small modular rectors and develop bespoke target set analyses to inform security postures based on probabilistic risk assessment. We find also that specific fission battery security economic analysis tools are needed and security by design must be applied early. However, the most important finding is that these new systems will require a new comprehensive set of cyber tools covering transportation, installation, operation, maintenance security of the fission battery systems. Overall, we find that the development of the necessary security and safeguards requirements at the design phase of such a technology will be of great benefit in the smooth deployment of this modern nuclear energy system.",false,2023-05-31,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149197023000628,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Smidts, Carol'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Reyes, Gustavo'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Endres de Oliveira, Cassiano'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Cao, Lei Raymond'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149197023000628'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149197023000628'}]",,application/json,,S0149-1970(23)00062-8,Published by Elsevier Ltd.,The research challenges in security and safeguards for nuclear fission batteries,© 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.,0,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Fission battery (FB)'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Security'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Safeguards'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Non-proliferation'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Cybersecurity'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Autonomous system'}]",false,Progress in Nuclear Energy,,104627,,fla,May 2023,10.1016/j.pnucene.2023.104627,104627,doi:10.1016/j.pnucene.2023.104627,,01491970,159,,,,104627,

However, the adoption of this technology has been slower due to the lack of clarity for specific applications. A discrete damped dynamic system is used in this paper to explore the concept of a digital twin. As digital twins are also expected to exploit data and computational methods, there is a compelling case for the use of surrogate models in this context. Motivated by this synergy, we have explored the possibility of using surrogate models within the digital twin technology. In particular, the use of Gaussian process (GP) emulator within the digital twin technology is explored. GP has the inherent capability of addressing noisy and sparse data and hence, makes a compelling case to be used within the digital twin framework. Cases involving stiffness variation and mass variation are considered, individually and jointly, along with different levels of noise and sparsity in data. Our numerical simulation results clearly demonstrate that surrogate models, such as GP emulators, have the potential to be an effective tool for the development of digital twins.

However, undergraduate students sometimes do lack industrial exposure and are unable to visualise the complexity of actual process plants. Thereby, students might graduate without adequate professional hands-on experience. Similarly, in the process industry, operator training-simulators are widely used for the training of new and skilled operators. However, conventional training-simulators often fail to simulate reality and do not provide the user with the opportunity to experience unexpected and hazardous scenarios. In these regards, virtual reality appears to be a promising technology that can cater to the needs of both academia and industry. This paper discusses the opportunities and challenges for the incorporation of virtual reality into chemical and biochemical engineering education with an emphasis on the fundamental areas of technology, pedagogy and socio-economics. The paper emphasises the need for augmenting virtual reality interfaces with mathematical models to develop advanced immersive learning applications. Further, the paper stresses upon the need for novel educational impact assessment methodologies for the evaluation of virtual-reality-based learning.

High-precision modelling of in-service power plant thermal systems plays a key role to develop digital twins, but remains a challenge. There is a lack of high-precision modelling for in-service power plant thermal systems over the full working ranges. This work proposes a hybrid modelling framework combining physical mechanism and operation data to develop grey-box models of thermal systems. Key equipment characteristics are figured out through historical operation data. Moreover, system models consisting of mass and energy balances, process mechanism equations and characteristic equations are implemented. An in-service 660 MW ultra-supercritical double reheat power plant, one of the most advanced thermal power generation technologies, is selected as a case study. The grey-box model of high- and intermediate-pressure thermal system is established. An average simulation error of the model of 0.79% over the full working ranges is achieved.

Effective characterization of the properties of such rocks based on their digital twins is a challenging task. Digital rock physics (DRP) can be used to quantify the structural and morphological parameters of rocks directly and predict flow transport properties at the pore scale. Digital rock chemistry (DRC) or biology (DRB) applies when the changes in pore structures are due to interaction with solutes or microbial activities. Fluid–rock interactions or microbial activities complicate fluid flow by introducing new heterogeneities at the pore scale. DRP/DRC/DRB modelling approaches can achieve an understanding of spatiotemporal porosity/permeability relationships that develop at the pore scale during reactive flow or microbial activities. There has recently been a surge in publications on the modelling of pore-scale models. However, this approach has many challenges, from theoretical issues such as how best to combine rock properties at different resolutions to technical challenges such as performing simulations using pore-scale models that contain too many pores and throats. Multiscale pore modelling approaches are generally categorized using the number of scales represented, the minimum being a dual-scale pore model, in which both void and porous voxels (e.g., unresolved pores) are modelled simultaneously. Two common approaches that can be implemented to predict rocks' behaviour across different scales are direct numerical simulation (DNS) and pore network model (PNM). Multiscale PNMs received more attention because of their ability to model a wide pore size distribution at various scales, while multiscale DNS requires resource-demanding Navier-Stokes-Brinkman models in GB voxel space.

Numerous unregenerated residential heritage buildings use portable heaters to adjust the indoor temperature for the comfort of occupants. However, research on the impact of heaters on the preservation of heritage buildings is limited. This paper proposes a novel and systematic approach based on digital twin technology to improve thermal performance effectively in unregenerated heritage buildings by arranging the locations and settings of heaters for improving building preservation. This research extended the functionality of heritage building information modeling (HBIM) to support simulations and decision-making to improve the thermal performance for heritage building preservation. An approach was proposed to address the lack of information by integrating documents, information, and graphics into an HBIM model for heritage building preservation. The digital model process based on HBIM presented in this study can be an effective 3D model for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. To investigate the impact of the heater on heritage building deformation, a novel method was developed to couple CFD and structural simulation to analyze the thermal performance and building deformation of heritage buildings. The heritage building deformation resulting from the heaters’ power setting and location was identified and quantified. In addition, using the proposed digital twin platform, heaters were controlled automatically. The thermal performance, building cracking and deformation were monitored and recorded automatically along the lifecycle.

Surprisingly, the degradation of aging-induced lifting capacity (LC) remains an unexplored domain. In response to this research gap, this paper introduces a digital twin-driven (DTD) framework and model to predict the degraded LC of aging tower cranes. This framework combines theoretical and numerical analysis of fatigue and degradation behavior in tower cranes with real-time vibration data obtained during cyclic load scenarios on the actual cranes. Machine learning (ML) techniques are employed to develop a model that accurately predicts the degraded LC caused by aging. A scaled-down tower crane prototype is adopted as a demonstrative case to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the DTD framework. The DTD model predicts the degraded LC of the prototype with high accuracy, achieving a mean-square error (MSE) of 0.2253 and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9973. The predicted degraded load charts of the tested tower crane for each decade of usage from 0 to 70 years are also presented to assist crane operators in applying safe loads, preventing unexpected failures and damages, and enhancing workplace monitoring and safety.

The evolution in production equipment and communication technologies, and the demand of markets for personalized mass production, have forced manufacturing companies to transform their production systems and prepare for a revolution. This revolution, known as Industry 4.0 (I4.0), or the digital transformation, has been introduced as a new type of organization of manufacturing systems that is more flexible and agile, and is based on using large amounts of information and data in the decision-making process. One of the main characteristics of this concept is decentralization, which allows different subsystems to make decisions autonomously in order to have self-organization systems. There are some important differences between the principles of WCM and I4.0. World class manufacturing is mainly based on continuous improvement and cost reduction, without a global vision for profit optimization. Industry 4.0 is mainly based on using all accessible information and data of systems and making decentralized decisions, but it also involves a global vision and a systemic approach to global profit optimization. However, achieving these objectives takes a very long time, and the challenges are numerous. As with all projects, for a transformation project to succeed, it is very important to define the transition phase and the way to change and introduce these new principles. This paper presents part of our research project, in collaboration with the Fiat Powertrain Technologies company, concerning the transformation of their production system toward the factory of the future.

Employee safety is a concern to increase productivity, delivery and achieve the required quality. The present research investigates the possibility of installing an automation procedure in an anodizing industry called GOLDEN ANODIZER, which is situated in Coimbatore, India. During the preliminary analysis at the specified industry premises, there was a reduction in productivity, quality and customer delivery due to manual operations, including some health issues were identified. And hence the present investigation analyses the possibility of installation of an automation system for the anodizing process. For such reason, the digital twin of an automation system is first designed, developed and tested using Siemens NX software. The anodizing factors such as Anodizing medium temperature (K), Acid Concentration (wt%), applied voltage (V) and Responses Surface Finish (Ra), Film Thickness (tf) and Time Duration (T) were optimized for improved productivity and quality. Prediction results and RMSE analysis show that the proposed hybrid PSO-LFA algorithm has outperformed all modern algorithms. The proposed algorithm optimized the anodizing parameters and suggested 3650.7 s as a new cycle time. Also, the improved cycle time can boost the plant outcome by 182% and reduce the manpower by 46% through the proposed Automation system.",false,2023-06-30,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0952197623002701,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'P., Vinodh Kumar'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'V., Manikandan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'G., Manavaalan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'S., Elango'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0952197623002701'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197623002701'}]",,application/json,,S0952-1976(23)00270-1,Elsevier Ltd.,Developing digital twin design for enhanced productivity of an automated anodizing industry and process prediction using hybrid deep neural network,© 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Context-awareness presents a viable approach to continuously model the surrounding context and relate it to the system’s operation. As the surrounding context is both acquirable from heterogeneous data sources and is dynamic in nature, a coherent and evolving context model is necessary. The context modeling approach needs to be both: system-centric to enable re-usability of the model by different applications as well as continuously and efficiently extendable to continuously represent the environment. Some approaches to model context within the manufacturing domain exist, but are mostly tailored to specific applications or do not consider an extension at runtime. To include the surrounding context of a system effectively and adapt it accordingly, a relation between the modeled context and the system during runtime is necessary. The intelligent Digital Twin provides essential interdisciplinary models of a physical system, which can be used for its analysis and monitoring. Adding a further service in the form of a model to represent the surrounding context enhances the intelligent Digital Twin to be used by various applications, e.g., for reconfiguration or decision-support. In our previous work, we have presented a tier-based model to realize context-awareness for intelligent Digital Twins. The presented tier model has different levels corresponding to different context scopes. In this contribution, we present an approach to realize an extendible and evolving tier-based context model with a generic ontology and model transformation to a labeled property graph with focus on the external context. To show the applicability and added value of the context model, a use case is presented, which addresses an intelligent warehouse’s Digital Twin and its context-model supported decision-making.",false,2022-12-31,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221282712200292X,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Sahlab, Nada'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Braun, Dominik'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Köhler, Christian'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Jazdi, Nasser'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Weyrich, Michael'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221282712200292X'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221282712200292X'}]",,application/json,Full,S2212-8271(22)00292-X,Published by Elsevier B.V.,Extending the Intelligent Digital Twin with a context modeling service: A decision support use case,© 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V.,1,,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'context-awareness'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Digital Twin'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'ontology'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'labeled property graph'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'intelligent warehouse'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'cyber-physical systems'}]",true,Procedia CIRP,ElsevierWaived,463-468,468,fla,2022,10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.009,463,doi:10.1016/j.procir.2022.05.009,,22128271,107,,,Leading manufacturing systems transformation – Proceedings of the 55th CIRP Conference on Manufacturing Systems 2022,,

At the same time, IT infrastructures are becoming more sophisticated as the number of software systems used increases and additional databases have to be integrated.

This can reduce the readiness for digitization topics in the company. As a result, collected data is not used and does not benefit companies as dark data. A current and promising topic in this context is the Digital Twin. The Digital Twin is a complex information technology concept that utilizes data to realistically represent the behaviour of a physical product for specific use cases.

Real-time monitoring can ensure safe production. A subsea production control system is the core of the subsea production system and the top priority to be monitored. Minor faults refer to faults with weak characteristics and are difficult to be found. They are common and pose significant risks in subsea production system. Safe operation of the system can be guaranteed to the greatest extent with a timely detection and handling of minor faults. Digital Twin driven fault diagnosis is an effective method to monitor the subsea production control system. However, the combination of digital twin and fault diagnosis is not comprehensive, especially in data interaction. It leads to the fact that digital twin cannot improve fault diagnosis accuracy significantly, mainly when a minor fault occurs. A cross-validation enhanced digital twin-driven fault diagnosis methodology for minor faults of the subsea production control system is proposed to achieve high accuracy. Control, loss and fault parameters are presented and used for building a digital twin model. Bayesian Networks are used to construct a fault diagnosis model. Single and cumulative errors are used to measure the difference between digital twin models and physical systems. A verification feedback method is used to check the diagnosis results.

However, conventional numerical methods suffer from low reliability and practicality due to the lack of usage of data that possess coherent physics in the system. The requirements to address this issue are system identification of data sequence and continuous modification to capture the changes of various environmental variables. Thus, we present the first data-driven digital twin model based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is well-suited for processing nonlinear, high-dimensional sequential data. It predicts pipeline flows and operating costs from measured data. Additionally, it adapts to changes in physical characteristics in pipelines. The proposed model was tested on real pipelines with a length of 5,000 km and demonstrated high accuracy, with a maximum error less than 0.2 MPa, and efficient computation, with a cost less than 2 s for 240 h. The proposed method constructs a reliable digital twin because it has the potential to be aware of the latent behavior of coherent physics in pipelines. The resulting digital twin forecast future status accurately and, based on this, may help establish advanced operating strategies in terms of safety and cost efficiency.",false,2023-07-01,,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360544223007119,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Koo, Bonchan'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Chang, Seungjoon'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Kwon, Hweeung'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360544223007119'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544223007119'}]",,application/json,,S0360-5442(23)00711-9,Elsevier Ltd.,Digital twin for natural gas infrastructure operation and management via streaming dynamic mode decomposition with control,© 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Such an improvement could be made in terms of an increase of efficiency for an existing process or the creation of something new, such as a new process, product, position (perception), or even a paradigm (mental model) (Tidd, Bessant et al., 2005). Not all innovations are therefore the same. Some are more disruptive, while others are incremental, reinforcing the existing order of things. This paper discusses the evolution of innovation as a management concept in the context of a physical product or technology and studies innovation from a longitudinal perspective, i.e., from a single physical product to a product family to smart services associated with the physical products and to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) in which physical products are now part of an extensive industrial network, namely the internet of things. How does the theme of innovation (management) change and evolve during this industry transition? More importantly, what are the managerial implications for innovating in the era of Industry 4.0?",false,2020-09-30,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,Journal,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2199853122005728,"[{'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Shum, Kwok'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Kodama, Fumio'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '$': 'Shibata, Tomoatsu'}]","[{'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'self', '@href': 'https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2199853122005728'}, {'@_fa': 'true', '@rel': 'scidir', '@href': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2199853122005728'}]",,application/json,Full,S2199-8531(22)00572-8,the authors.
